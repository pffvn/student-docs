            <a data-primary="Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)" data-secondary=
            "basic components of" data-type="indexterm" id="id-7nCJSgFl"></a>Software engineering
            has this in common with having children: the labor <em>before</em> the birth is painful
            and difficult, but the labor <em>after</em> the birth is where you actually spend most
            of your effort. Yet software engineering as a discipline spends much more time talking
            about the first period as opposed to the second, despite estimates that 40–90% of the
            total costs of a system are incurred after birth.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href=
            "preface.html#id-p8BuwtjFz" id="id-p8BuwtjFz-marker">1</a></sup> The popular industry model that
            conceives of deployed, operational software as being “stabilized” in production, and
            therefore needing much less attention from software engineers, is wrong. Through this
            lens, then, we see that if software engineering tends to focus on designing and
            building software systems, there must be another discipline that focuses on the
            <em>whole</em> lifecycle of software objects, from inception, through deployment and
            operation, refinement, and eventual peaceful decommissioning. This discipline uses—and
            needs to use—a wide range of skills, but has separate concerns from other kinds of
            engineers. Today, our answer is the discipline Google calls Site Reliability
            Engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what exactly is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)? We admit that it’s not a
            particularly clear name for what we do—pretty much every site reliability engineer at
            Google gets asked what exactly that is, and what they actually do, on a regular basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unpacking the term a little, first and foremost, SREs are <em>engineers</em>. We apply
            the principles of computer science and engineering to the design and development of
            computing systems: generally, large distributed ones. Sometimes, our task is writing
            the software for those systems alongside our product development counterparts;
            sometimes, our task is building all the additional pieces those systems need, like
            backups or load balancing, ideally so they can be reused across systems; and sometimes,
            our task is figuring out how to apply existing solutions to new problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a data-primary="reliability testing" data-secondary="importance of" data-type=
            "indexterm" id="id-bGCmS4hP"></a>Next, we focus on system <em>reliability</em>. Ben
            Treynor Sloss, Google’s VP for 24/7 Operations, originator of the term SRE, claims that
            reliability is the most fundamental feature of any product: a system isn’t very useful
            if nobody can use it! Because reliability<sup><a data-type="noteref" href=
            "preface.html#id-gA2u2Iyh4" id="id-gA2u2Iyh4-marker">2</a></sup> is so critical, SREs are focused
            on finding ways to improve the design and operation of systems to make them more
            scalable, more reliable, and more efficient. However, we expend effort in this
            direction only up to a point: when systems are “reliable enough,” we instead invest our
            efforts in adding features or building new products.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href=
            "preface.html#id-qpMuvtVhy" id="id-qpMuvtVhy-marker">3</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            <a data-primary="service management" data-secondary="comprehensive approach to"
            data-type="indexterm" id="id-KnCnSnTj"></a>Finally, SREs are focused on operating
            <em>services</em> built atop our distributed computing systems, whether those services
            are planet-scale storage, email for hundreds of millions of users, or where Google
            began, web search. The “site” in our name originally referred to SRE’s role in keeping
            the <em>google.com</em> website running, though we now run many more services, many of
            which aren’t themselves websites—from internal infrastructure such as Bigtable to
            products for external developers such as the Google Cloud Platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a data-primary="Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)" data-secondary="origins of"
            data-type="indexterm" id="id-aeCvSacp"></a>Although we have represented SRE as a broad
            discipline, it is no surprise that it arose in the fast-moving world of web services,
            and perhaps in origin owes something to the peculiarities of our infrastructure. It is
            equally no surprise that of all the post-deployment characteristics of software that we
            could choose to devote special attention to, reliability is the one we regard as
            primary.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="preface.html#id-qpMuAFAcy" id=
            "id-qpMuAFAcy-marker">4</a></sup> The domain of web services, both because the process
            of improving and changing server-side software is comparatively contained, and because
            managing change itself is so tightly coupled with failures of all kinds, is a natural
            platform from which our approach might emerge.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a data-primary="Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)" data-secondary=
            "widespread applications of" data-type="indexterm" id="id-0nCXS4ir"></a>Despite arising
            at Google, and in the web community more generally, we think that this discipline has
            lessons applicable to other communities and other organizations. This book is an
            attempt to explain how we do things: both so that other organizations might make use of
            what we’ve learned, and so that we can better define the role and what the term means.
            To that end, we have organized the book so that general principles and more specific
            practices are separated where possible, and where it’s appropriate to discuss a
            particular topic with Google-specific information, we trust that the reader will
            indulge us in this and will not be afraid to draw useful conclusions about their own
            environment.
          </p>
          <p class="pagebreak-before">
            We have also provided some orienting material—a description of Google’s production
            environment and a mapping between some of our internal software and publicly available
            software—which should help to contextualize what we are saying and make it more
            directly usable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, of course, more reliability-oriented software and systems engineering is
            inherently good. However, we acknowledge that smaller organizations may be wondering
            how they can best use the experience represented here: much like security, the earlier
            you care about reliability, the better. This implies that even though a small
            organization has many pressing concerns and the software choices you make may differ
            from those Google made, it’s still worth putting lightweight reliability support in
            place early on, because it’s less costly to expand a structure later on than it is to
            introduce one that is not present. <a data-type="xref" href=
            "part4.html">Management</a> contains a number of best practices for
            training, communication, and meetings that we’ve found to work well for us, many of
            which should be immediately usable by your organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            But for sizes between a startup and a multinational, there probably already is someone
            in your organization who is doing SRE work, without it necessarily being called that
            name, or recognized as such. Another way to get started on the path to improving
            reliability for your organization is to formally recognize that work, or to find these
            people and foster what they do—reward it. They are people who stand on the cusp between
            one way of looking at the world and another one: like Newton, who is sometimes called
            not the world’s first physicist, but the world’s last alchemist.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a data-primary="Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)" data-secondary="early engineers"
            data-type="indexterm" id="id-e4CzSvsG"></a>And taking the historical view, who, then,
            looking back, might be the first SRE?
          </p>
          <p>
            We like to think that Margaret Hamilton, working on the Apollo program on loan from
            MIT, had all of the significant traits of the first SRE.<sup><a data-type="noteref"
            href="preface.html#id-na2u1SWHw" id="id-na2u1SWHw-marker">5</a></sup> In her own words, "part of
            the culture was to learn from everyone and everything, including from that which one
            would least expect."
          </p>
          <p>
            <a data-primary="cross-industry lessons" data-secondary="Apollo 8" data-type=
            "indexterm" id="id-DnC1SBfJ"></a>A case in point was when her young daughter Lauren
            came to work with her one day, while some of the team were running mission scenarios on
            the hybrid simulation computer. As young children do, Lauren went exploring, and she
            caused a "mission" to crash by selecting the DSKY keys in an unexpected way, alerting
            the team as to what would happen if the prelaunch program, P01, were inadvertently
            selected by a real astronaut during a real mission, during real midcourse. (Launching
            P01 inadvertently on a real mission would be a major problem, because it wipes out
            navigation data, and the computer was not equipped to pilot the craft with no
            navigation data.)
          </p>
          <p class="pagebreak-before">
            With an SRE’s instincts, Margaret submitted a program change request to add special
            error checking code in the on­board flight software in case an astronaut should, by
            accident, happen to select P01 during flight. But this move was considered unnecessary
            by the "higher-ups" at NASA: of course, that could never happen! So instead of adding
            error checking code, Margaret updated the mission specifications documentation to say
            the equivalent of "Do not select P01 during flight." (Apparently the update was amusing
            to many on the project, who had been told many times that astronauts would not make any
            mistakes—after all, they were trained to be perfect.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, Margaret’s suggested safeguard was only considered unnecessary until the very
            next mission, on Apollo 8, just days after the specifications update. During midcourse
            on the fourth day of flight with the astronauts Jim Lovell, William Anders, and Frank
            Borman on board, Jim Lovell selected P01 by mistake—as it happens, on Christmas
            Day—creating much havoc for all involved. This was a critical problem, because in the
            absence of a workaround, no navigation data meant the astronauts were never coming
            home. Thankfully, the documentation update had explicitly called this possibility out,
            and was invaluable in figuring out how to upload usable data and recover the mission,
            with not much time to spare.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Margaret says, "a thorough understanding of how to operate the systems was not
            enough to prevent human errors," and the change request to add error detection and
            recovery software to the prelaunch program P01 was approved shortly afterwards.
          </p>

            Although the Apollo 8 incident occurred decades ago, there is much in the preceding
            paragraphs directly relevant to engineers’ lives today, and much that will continue to
            be directly relevant in the future. Accordingly, for the systems you look after, for
            the groups you work in, or for the organizations you’re building, please bear the SRE
            Way in mind: thoroughness and dedication, belief in the value of preparation and
            documentation, and an awareness of what could go wrong, coupled with a strong desire to
            prevent it. Welcome to our emerging profession!

              How to Read This Book
            </h5>
            <p>
              <a data-primary="Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)" data-secondary=
              "approach to learning" data-type="indexterm" id="id-zdCxSGFGhq"></a>This book is a
              series of essays written by members and alumni of Google’s Site Reliability
              Engineering organization. It’s much more like conference proceedings than it is like
              a standard book by an author or a small number of authors. Each chapter is intended
              to be read as a part of a coherent whole, but a good deal can be gained by reading on
              whatever subject particularly interests you. (If there are other articles that
              support or inform the text, we reference them so you can follow up accordingly.)
            </p>
            <p>
              You don’t need to read in any particular order, though we’d suggest at least starting
              with Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href=
              "production-environment.html">The Production Environment at
              Google, from the Viewpoint of an SRE</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle=
              "select:labelnumber" href="embracing-risk.html">Embracing
              Risk</a>, which describe Google’s production environment and outline how SRE
              approaches risk, respectively. (Risk is, in many ways, the key quality of our
              profession.) Reading cover-to-cover is, of course, also useful and possible; our
              chapters are grouped thematically, into Principles (<a data-type="xref" href=
              "part2.html">Principles</a>), Practices (<a data-type="xref" href=
              "part3.html">Practices</a>), and Management (<a data-type="xref"
              href="part4.html">Management</a>). Each has a small introduction
              that highlights what the individual pieces are about, and references other articles
              published by Google SREs, covering specific topics in more detail. Additionally, the
              companion website to this book, <a href="https://g.co/SREBook"><em class=
              "hyperlink">https://g.co/SREBook</em></a>, has a number of helpful resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              We hope this will be at least as useful and interesting to you as putting it together
              was for us.

              This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, if example code is
              offered with this book, you may use it in your programs and documentation. You do not
              need to contact us for permission unless you’re reproducing a significant portion of
              the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this
              book does not require permission. Selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples from
              O’Reilly books does require permission. Answering a question by citing this book and
              quoting example code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount
              of example code from this book into your product’s documentation does require
              permission.

              We very much appreciate the thoughtful and in-depth feedback that we received from
              external reviewers: Andrew Fong, Björn Rabenstein, Charles Border, David
              Blank-Edelman, Frossie Economou, James Meickle, Josh Ryder, Mark Burgess, and Russ

              We would like to extend special thanks to Cian Synnott, original book team member and
              co-conspirator, who left Google before this project was completed but was deeply
              influential to it, and Margaret Hamilton, who so graciously allowed us to reference
              her story in our preface. Additionally, we would like to extend special thanks to
              Shylaja Nukala, who generously gave of the time of her technical writers and
              supported their necessary and valued efforts wholeheartedly.
            </p>

              The editors would also like to personally thank the following people:
            </p>
            <p>
              Betsy Beyer: To Grandmother (my personal hero), for supplying endless amounts of
              phone pep talks and popcorn, and to Riba, for supplying me with the sweatpants
              necessary to fuel several late nights. These, of course, in addition to the cast of
              SRE all-stars who were indeed delightful collaborators.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chris Jones: To Michelle, for saving me from a life of crime on the high seas and for
              her uncanny ability to find manzanas in unexpected places, and to those who’ve taught
              me about engineering over the years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jennifer Petoff: To my husband Scott for being incredibly supportive during the two
              year process of writing this book and for keeping the editors supplied with plenty of
              sugar on our "Dessert Island."
            </p>
            <p>
              Niall Murphy: To Léan, Oisín, and Fiachra, who were considerably more patient than I
              had any right to expect with a substantially rantier father and husband than usual,
              for years. To Dermot, for the transfer offer.<a data-startref="ack0" data-type=

              discipline, but see, e.g., <a data-type="xref" href=
