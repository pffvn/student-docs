              You’ve Hired Your Next SRE(s), Now What?

              employees into your organization, and they’re starting as Site Reliability Engineers.
              Now you have to train them on the job. Investing up front in the education and
              technical orientation of new SREs will shape them into better engineers. Such
              training will accelerate them to a state of proficiency faster, while making their
              skill set more robust and balanced.
            </p>
            <p>
              Successful SRE teams are built on trust—in order to maintain a service consistently
              and globally, you need to trust that your fellow on-callers know how your system
              works,<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="accelerating-sre-on-call.html#id-yJLuAS1Inhl" id=
              "id-yJLuAS1Inhl-marker">135</a></sup> can diagnose atypical system behaviors, are
              comfortable with reaching out for help, and can react under pressure to save the day.
              It is essential, then, but not sufficient, to think of SRE education through the lens
              of, "What does a newbie need to learn to go on-call?" Given the requirements
              regarding trust, you also need to ask questions like:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>How can my existing on-callers assess the readiness of the newbie for on-call?
              </li>
              <li>How can we harness the enthusiasm and curiosity in our new hires to make sure
              that existing SREs benefit from it?
              </li>
              <li>What activities can I commit our team to that benefit everyone’s education, but
              that everyone will like?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Students have a wide range of learning preferences. Recognizing that you will hire
              people who have a mix of these preferences, it would be shortsighted to only cater to
              one style at the expense of the others. Thus, there is no style of education that
              works best to train new SREs, and there is certainly no one magic formula that will
              work for all SRE teams. <a data-type="xref" href="accelerating-sre-on-call.html#table_training_patterns">Table
              28-1</a> lists recommended training practices (and their corresponding anti-patterns)

              options available for making your team well educated in SRE concepts, both now and on

              The rest of this chapter presents major themes that we have found to be effective in
              accelerating SREs to on-call and beyond. These concepts can be visualized in a
              blueprint for bootstrapping SREs (<a data-type="xref" href=
              "accelerating-sre-on-call.html#fig_training_accelerating-sre">Figure 28-1</a>).

              id="id-MnCNSju0hg"></a>This illustration captures best practices that SRE teams can
              pick from to help bootstrap new members, while keeping senior talent fresh. From the
              many tools here, you can pick and choose the activities that best suit your team.

              The illustration has two axes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The x-axis represents the <em>spectrum between different types of work</em>,
              ranging from abstract to applied activities.
              </li>
              <li>The y-axis represents <em>time</em>. Read from the top down, new SREs have very
              little knowledge about the systems and services they’ll be responsible for, so
              postmortems detailing how these systems have failed in the past are a good starting
              point. New SREs can also try to reverse engineer systems from fundamentals, since
              they’re starting from zero. Once they understand more about their systems and have
              done some hands-on work, SREs are ready to shadow on-call and to start mending
              incomplete or out-of-date documentation.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Tips for interpreting this illustration:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <em>Going on-call</em> is a milestone in a new SRE’s career, after which point
                learning becomes a lot more nebulous, undefined, and self-directed—hence the dashed
                lines around activities that happen at or after the SRE goes on-call.
              </li>
              <li>The triangular shape of <em>project work &amp; ownership</em> indicates that
              project work starts out small and builds over time, becoming more complex and likely
              continuing well after going on-call.
              </li>
              <li>Some of these activities and practices are very abstract/passive, and some are
              very applied/active. A few activities are mixes of both. It’s good to have a variety
              of learning modalities to suit different learning styles.
              </li>
              <li>For maximum effect, training activities and practices should be appropriately
              paced: some are appropriate to undertake straightaway, some should happen right
              before an SRE officially goes on-call, and some should be continual and ongoing even
              by seasoned SREs. <em>Concrete learning experiences</em> should happen for the entire
              time leading up to the SRE going on-call.
              </li>

              team to contain and reduce reactive work through ample proactivity, and the approach
              you take to onboarding your newbie(s) should be no exception. Consider the following
              all-too-common, but sadly suboptimal, onboarding process:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="quote">
                John is the newest member of the FooServer SRE team. Senior SREs on this team are
                tasked with a lot of grunt work, such as responding to tickets, dealing with
                alerts, and performing tedious binary rollouts. On John’s first day on the job, he
                is assigned all new incoming tickets. He is told that he can ask any member of the
                SRE team to help him obtain the background necessary to decipher a ticket. "Sure,
                there will be a lot of upfront learning that you’ll have to do," says John’s
                manager, "but eventually you’ll get much faster at these tickets. One day, it will
                just <em>click</em> and you’ll know a lot about all of the tools we use, the
                procedures we follow, and the systems we maintain." A senior team member comments,
                "We’re throwing you in the deep end of the pool here."
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              This "trial by fire" method of orienting one’s newbies is often born out of a team’s
              current environment; ops-driven, reactive SRE teams "train" their newest members by
              making them…well, react! Over and over again. If you’re lucky, the engineers who are
              already good at navigating ambiguity will crawl out of the hole you’ve put them in.
              But chances are, this strategy has alienated several capable engineers. While such an
              approach may eventually produce great operations employees, its results will fall
              short of the mark. The trial-by-fire approach also presumes that many or most aspects
              of a team can be taught strictly by doing, rather than by reasoning. If the set of
              work one encounters in a tickets queue will adequately provide training for said job,
              then this is not an SRE position.
            </p>
            <p>
              SRE students will have questions like the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What am I working on?
              </li>
              <li>How much progress have I made?
              </li>
              <li>When will these activities accumulate enough experience for me to go on-call?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Making the jump from a previous company or university, while changing job roles (from
              traditional software engineer or traditional systems administrator) to this nebulous
              <em>Site Reliability Engineer</em> role is often enough to knock students’ confidence
              down several times. For more introspective personalities (especially regarding
              questions #2 and #3), the uncertainties incurred by nebulous or less-than-clear
              answers can lead to slower development or retention problems. Instead, consider the
              approaches outlined in the following sections. These suggestions are as concrete as
              any ticket or alert, but they are also sequential, and thus far more rewarding.

                Any type of training is better than random tickets and interrupts, but do make a
                conscious effort to combine the right mix of theory and application: abstract
                concepts that will recur multiple times in a newbie’s journey should be
                <span class="keep-together">frontloaded</span> in their education, while the
                student should also receive hands-on experience as soon as practically possible.

                Learning about your stack(s) and subsystem(s) requires a starting point. Consider
                whether it makes more sense to group trainings together by similarity of purpose,
                or by normal-case order of execution. For example, if your team is responsible for
                a real-time, user-facing serving stack, consider a curriculum order like the
                following:

                How you choose to present the learning opportunities (informal whiteboard chats,
                formal lectures, or hands-on discovery exercises) is up to you and the SREs helping
                you structure, design, and deliver training. The Google Search SRE team structures
                this learning through a document called the "on-call learning checklist." A

                strictly on enumerating expert contacts, highlighting the most useful documentation
                resources, establishing basic knowledge you must gather and internalize, and asking
                probing questions that can only be answered once that basic knowledge has been
                absorbed. It also provides concrete outcomes, so that the student knows what kinds

                It’s a good idea for all interested parties to get a sense of how much information
                the trainee is retaining. While this feedback mechanism perhaps doesn’t need to be
                as formal as a quiz, it is a good practice to have complete bits of homework that
                pose questions about how your service(s) work. Satisfactory answers, checked by a
                student’s mentor, are a sign that learning should continue to the next phase.
                Questions about the inner workings of your service might look similar to the
                following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Which backends of this server are considered "in the critical path," and why?
                </li>
                <li>What aspects of this server could be simplified or automated?
                </li>
                <li>Where do you think the first bottleneck is in this architecture? If that
                bottleneck were to be saturated, what steps could you take to alleviate it?
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Depending on how the access permissions are configured for your service, you can
                also consider implementing a tiered access model. The first tier of access would
                allow your student read-only access to the inner workings of the components, and a
                later tier would permit them to mutate the production state. Completing sections of
                the on-call learning checklist satisfactorily would earn the student progressively
                deeper access to the system. The Search SRE team calls these attained levels
                "powerups"<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="accelerating-sre-on-call.html#id-YAJuDSBUWiyTr" id=

                hearty problem to solve! When starting out, having even a minor sense of ownership
                in the team’s service can do wonders for learning. In the reverse, such ownership
                can also make great inroads for trust building among senior colleagues, because
                they will approach their junior colleague to learn about the new component(s) or
                processes. Early opportunities for ownership are standard across Google in general:
                all engineers are given a starter project that’s meant to provide a tour through
                the infrastructure sufficient to enable them to make a small but useful
                contribution early. Having the new SRE split time between learning <em>and</em>
                project work will also give them a sense of purpose and productivity, which would
                not happen if they spent time only on learning <em>or</em> project work. Several
                starter project patterns that seem to work well include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Making a trivial user-visible feature change in a serving stack, and
                subsequently shepherding the feature release all the way through to production.
                Understanding both the development toolchain and the binary release process
                encourages empathy for the developers.
                </li>
                <li>Adding monitoring to your service where there are currently blind spots. The
                newbie will have to reason with the monitoring logic, while reconciling their
                understanding of a system with how it actually (mis)behaves.
                </li>
                <li>Automating a pain point that isn’t quite painful enough to have been automated
                already, providing the new SRE with an appreciation for the value SREs place on
                removing toil from our day-to-day operations.

              new SREs, but <em>what</em> should we train them on? Training material will depend on
              the technologies being used on the job, but the more important question is: what kind
              of engineers are we trying to create? At the scale and complexity at which SREs
              operate, they cannot afford to merely be operations-focused, traditional system
              administrators. In addition to having a large-scale engineering mindset, SREs should
              exhibit the following characteristics:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>In the course of their jobs, they will come across systems they’ve never seen
              before, so they need to have <em>strong reverse engineering skills</em>.
              </li>
              <li>At scale, there will be anomalies that are hard to detect, so they’ll need the
              ability to <em>think statistically</em>, rather than procedurally, to uncloak
              problems.
              </li>
              <li>When standard operating procedures break down, they’ll need to be able to
              <em>improvise fully</em>.

            </ul>
            <p>
              Let’s examine these attributes further, so that we can understand how to equip our
              SREs for these skills and behaviors.

                company, along with a willingness to dig deep into the debugging tools, RPC
                boundaries, and logs of your binaries to unearth their flows, SREs will become more
                efficient at homing in on unexpected problems in unexpected system architectures.
                Teach your SREs about the diagnostic and debugging surfaces of your applications
                and have them practice drawing inferences from the information these surfaces
                reveal, so that such behavior becomes reflexive when dealing with future outages.

              <p>
                You can think of an SRE’s approach to incident response for large-scale systems as
                navigating through a massive decision tree unfolding in front of them. In the
                limited time window afforded by the demands of incident response, the SRE can take
                a few actions out of hundreds with the goal of mitigating the outage, either in the
                short term or the long term. Because time is often of the utmost importance, the
                SRE has to effectively and efficiently prune this decision tree. The ability to do
                so is partially gained through experience, which only comes with time and exposure
                to a breadth of production systems. This experience must be paired with careful
                construction of hypotheses that, when proven or disproven, even further narrow down
                that decision space. Put another way, tracking down system breakages is often akin
                to playing a game of "which of these things is not like the other?" where "things"
                might entail kernel version, CPU architecture, binary version(s) in your stack,
                regional traffic mix, or a hundred other factors. Architecturally, it’s the team’s
                responsibility to ensure all of these factors can be controlled for and
                individually analyzed and compared. However, we should also train our newest SREs
                to become good analysts and comparators from their earliest moments on the job.

                You try out a fix for the breakage, but it doesn’t work. The developer(s) behind
                the failing system are nowhere to be found. What do you do now? You improvise!
                Learning multiple tools that can solve parts of your problem allows you to practice
                defense in depth in your own problem-solving behaviors. Being too procedural in the
                face of an outage, thus forgetting your analytical skills, can be the difference
                between getting stuck and finding the root cause. A case of bogged-down
                troubleshooting can be further compounded when an SRE brings too many untested
                assumptions about the cause of an outage into their decision making. Demonstrating
                that there are many analytical traps that SREs can fall into, which require
                "zooming out" and taking a different approach to resolution, is a valuable lesson
                for SREs to learn early on.

                Given these three aspirational attributes of high-performing SREs, what courses and
                experiences can we provide new SREs in order to send them along a path in the right
                direction? You need to come up with your own course content that embodies these
                attributes, in addition to the other attributes specific to your SRE culture. Let’s
                consider one class that we believe hits all of the aforementioned points.

                One popular class we offer at Google is called "Reverse Engineering a Production
                Service (without help from its owners)." The problem scenario presented appears
                simple at first. The entire Google News Team—SRE, Software Engineers, Product
                Management, and so forth—has gone on a company trip: a cruise of the Bermuda
                Triangle. We haven’t heard from the team for 30 days, so our students are the newly
                appointed Google News SRE Team. They need to figure out how the serving stack works
                from end-to-end in order to commandeer it and keep it running.
              </p>
              <p>
                After being given this scenario, the students are led through interactive,
                purpose-driven exercises in which they trace the inbound path of their web
                browser’s query through Google’s infrastructure. At each stage in the process, we
                emphasize that it is important to learn multiple ways to discover the connectivity
                between production servers, so that connections are not missed. In the middle of
                the class, we challenge the students to find another endpoint for the incoming
                traffic, demonstrating that our initial assumption was too narrowly scoped. We then
                challenge our students to find other ways into the stack. We exploit the highly
                instrumented nature of our production binaries, which self-report their RPC
                connectivity, as well as our available white-box and black-box monitoring, to
                determine which path(s) users’ queries take.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href=
                "accelerating-sre-on-call.html#id-p8BuzSWtmiXca" id="id-p8BuzSWtmiXca-marker">139</a></sup> Along the way, we
                build a system diagram and also discuss components that are shared infrastructure
                that our students are likely to see again in the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of the class, the students are charged with a task. Each student returns
                to their home team and asks a senior SRE to help them select a stack or slice of a
                stack for which they’ll be on-call. Using the skills learned in classes, the
                student then diagrams that stack on their own and presents their findings to the
                senior SRE. Undoubtedly the student will miss a few subtle details, which will make
                for a good discussion. It’s also likely that the senior SRE will learn something
                from the exercise as well, exposing drifts in their prior understanding of the
                ever-changing system. Because of the rapid change of production systems, it is
                important that your team welcome any chance to refamiliarize themselves with a
                system, including by learning from the newest, rather than oldest, members of the
                team.

                way of getting at the many root causes of a significant or visible outage. When
                writing a postmortem, keep in mind that its most appreciative audience might be an
                engineer who hasn’t yet been hired. Without radical editing, subtle changes can be
                made to our best postmortems to make them "teachable" postmortems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even the best postmortems aren’t helpful if they languish in the bottom of a
                virtual filing cabinet. It then follows that your team should collect and curate
                valuable postmortems to serve as educational resources for future newbies. Some
                postmortems are rote, but "teachable postmortems" that provide insights into
                structural or novel failures of large-scale systems are as good as gold for new
                students.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ownership of postmortems isn’t limited just to authorship. It’s a point of pride
                for many teams to have survived and documented their largest outages. Collect your
                best postmortems and make them prominently available for your newbies—in addition
                to interested parties from related and/or integrating teams—to read. Ask related
                teams to publish their best postmortems where you can access them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some SRE teams at Google run "postmortem reading clubs" where fascinating and
                insightful postmortems are circulated, pre-read, and then discussed. The original
                author(s) of the postmortem can be the guest(s) of honor at the meeting. Other
                teams organize "tales of fail" gatherings where the postmortem author(s)
                semiformally present, recounting the outage and effectively driving the discussion
                themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regular readings or presentations on outages, including trigger conditions and
                mitigation steps, do wonders for building a new SRE’s mental map and understanding
                of production and on-call response. Postmortems are also excellent fuel for future
                abstract disaster scenarios.<a data-primary="" data-startref="OCtrain28" data-type=

                  Once a week we have a meeting where a victim is chosen to be on the spot in front
                  of the group, and a scenario—often a real one taken from the annals of Google
                  history—is thrown at him or her. The victim, whom I think of as a game show
                  contestant, tells the game show host what s/he would do or query to understand or
                  solve the problem, and the host tells the victim what happens with each action or
                  observation. It's like <em>SRE Zork</em>. You are in a maze of twisty monitoring
                  consoles, all alike. You must save innocent users from slipping into the Chasm of
                  Excessive Query Latency, save datacenters from Near-Certain Meltdown, and spare

                "id-MnCNSnIGtqiv"></a>When you have a group of SREs of wildly different experience
                levels, what can you do to bring them all together, and enable them to learn from
                each other? How do you impress the SRE culture and problem-solving nature of your
                team upon a newbie, while also keeping grizzled veterans apprised of new changes
                and features in your stack? Google SRE teams address these challenges through a
                time-honored tradition of regular disaster role playing. Among other names, this
                exercise is commonly referred to as "Wheel of Misfortune" or "Walk the Plank." The
                sense of humorous danger such titles lend the exercise makes it less intimidating
                to freshly hired SREs.
              </p>
              <p>
                At its best, these exercises become a weekly ritual in which every member of the
                group learns something. The formula is straightforward and bears some resemblance
                to a tabletop RPG (Role Playing Game): the "game master" (GM) picks two team
                members to be primary and secondary on-call; these two SREs join the GM at the
                front of the room. An incoming page is announced, and the on-call team responds
                with what they would do to mitigate and investigate the outage.
              </p>
              <p>
                The GM has carefully prepared a scenario that is about to unfold. This scenario
                might be based upon a previous outage for which the newer team members weren’t
                around or that older team members have forgotten. Or perhaps the scenario is a
                foray into a hypothetical breakage of a new or soon-to-be-launched feature in the
                stack, rendering all members of the room equally unprepared to grapple with the
                situation. Better still, a coworker might find a new and novel breakage in
                production, and today’s scenario expands on this new threat.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the next 30–60 minutes, the primary and secondary on-callers attempt to
                root-cause the issue. The GM happily provides additional context as the problem
                unfolds, perhaps informing the on-callers (and their audience) of what the graphs
                on their monitoring dashboard might look like during the outage. If the incident
                requires escalation outside of the home team, the GM pretends to be a member of
                that other team for the purposes of the scenario. No virtual scenario will be
                perfect, so at times the GM may have to steer participants back on track by
                redirecting the on-callers away from red herrings, introducing urgency and clarity
                by adding other stimuli,<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="accelerating-sre-on-call.html#id-2opuzSrTltJir" id=
                "id-2opuzSrTltJir-marker">141</a></sup> or asking urgent and pointed
                questions.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="accelerating-sre-on-call.html#id-p8BuqF0TbtOia" id=

              </p>
              <p>
                When your disaster RPG is successful, everyone will have learned something: perhaps
                a new tool or trick, a different perspective on how to solve a problem, or
                (especially gratifying to new team members) a validation that you could have solved
                this week’s problem if you had been picked. With some luck, this exercise will
                inspire teammates to eagerly look forward to next week’s adventure or to ask to
                become the game master for an upcoming week.

              <p>
                A newbie can learn much about SRE by reading documentation, postmortems, and taking
                trainings. Disaster role playing can help get a newbie’s mind into the game.
                However, the experience derived from hands-on experience breaking and/or fixing
                <em>real</em> production systems is even better. There will be plenty of time for
                hands-on experience once a newbie has gone on-call, but such learning should happen
                <em>before</em> a new SRE reaches that point. Therefore, provide for such hands-on
                experiences much earlier in order to develop the student’s reflexive responses for
                using your company’s tooling and monitoring to approach a developing outage.
              </p>
              <p>
                Realism is paramount in these interactions. Ideally, your team has a stack that is
                <span class="keep-together">multihomed</span> and provisioned in such a way that
                you have at least one instance you can divert from live traffic and temporarily
                loan to a learning exercise. Alternatively, you might have a smaller, but still
                fully featured, staging or QA instance of your stack that can be borrowed for a
                short time. If possible, subject the stack to synthetic load that approximates real
                user/client traffic, in addition to resource consumption, if possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                The opportunities for learning from a real production system under synthetic load
                are abundant. Senior SREs will have experienced all sorts of troubles:
                misconfigurations, memory leaks, performance regressions, crashing queries, storage
                bottlenecks, and so forth. In this realistic but relatively risk-free environment,
                proctors can manipulate the job set in ways that alter the behavior of the stack,
                forcing new SREs to find differences, determine contributing factors, and
                ultimately repair systems to restore appropriate behavior.
              </p>
              <p>
                As an alternative to the overhead of asking a senior SRE to carefully plan a
                specific type of breakage that the new SRE(s) must repair, you can also work in the
                opposite direction with an exercise that may also increase participation from the
                entire team: work from a known good configuration and slowly impair the stack at
                selected bottlenecks, observing upstream and downstream efforts through your
                monitoring. This exercise is valued by the Google Search SRE team, whose version of
                this exercise is called "Let’s burn a search cluster to the ground!" The exercise
                proceeds as follows:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>As a group, we discuss what observable performance characteristics might change
                as we cripple the stack.
                </li>
                <li>Before inflicting the planned damage, we poll the participants for their
                guesses and reasoning about their predictions about how the system will react.
                </li>
                <li>We validate assumptions and justify the reasoning behind the behaviors we see.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                This exercise, which we perform on a quarterly basis, shakes out new bugs that we
                eagerly fix, because our systems do not always degrade as gracefully as we would
                expect.

                checklist," which is an organized reading and comprehension list of the
                technologies and concepts relevant to the system(s) they maintain. This list must
                be internalized by a student before they’re eligible to serve as a shadow
                on-caller. Take a moment to revisit the example on-call learning checklist in
                <a data-type="xref" href="accelerating-sre-on-call.html#table_training_checklist">Table 28-2</a>. The learning
                checklist serves different purposes for different people:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>To the student</strong>:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>This doc helps establish the boundaries of the system their team supports.
                    </li>
                    <li>By studying this list, the student gains a sense of what systems are most
                    important and why. When they understand the information therein, they can move
                    on to other topics they need to learn, rather than dwelling on learning
                    esoteric details that can be learned over time.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    <strong>To mentors and managers</strong>: Student progress through the learning
                    checklist can be observed. The checklist answers questions such as:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>What sections are you working on today?
                    </li>
                    <li>What sections are the most confusing?
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>To all team members</strong>: The doc becomes a social contract by
                    which (upon mastery) the student joins the ranks of on-call. The learning
                    checklist sets the standard that all team members should aspire to and uphold.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In a rapidly changing environment, documentation can fall out of date quickly.
                Outdated documentation is less of a problem for senior SREs who are already up to
                speed, because they keep state on the world and its changes in their own heads.
                Newbie SREs are much more in need of up-to-date documentation, but may not feel
                empowered or knowledgeable enough to make changes. When designed with just the
                right amount of structure, on-call documentation can become an adaptable body of
                work that harnesses newbie enthusiasm and senior knowledge to keep everyone fresh.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Search SRE, we anticipate the arrival of new team member(s) by reviewing our
                on-call learning checklist, and sorting its sections by how up-to-date they are. As
                the new team member arrives, we point them to the overall learning checklist, but
                also task them with overhauling one or two of the most outdated sections. As you
                can see in <a data-type="xref" href="accelerating-sre-on-call.html#table_training_checklist">Table 28-2</a>, we
                label the senior SRE and developer contacts for each technology. We encourage the
                student to make an early connection with those subject matter experts, so that they
                might learn the inner workings of the selected technology directly. Later, as they
                become more familiar with the scope and tone of the learning checklist, they are
                expected to contribute a revised learning checklist section, which must be
                peer-reviewed by one or more senior SREs that are listed as experts.

                other training mechanisms will fully prepare an SRE for going on-call. At the end
                of the day, tackling real outages will always be more beneficial from a learning
                standpoint than engaging with hypotheticals. Yet it’s unfair to make newbies wait
                until their first real page to have a chance to learn and retain knowledge.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the student has made their way through all system fundamentals (by
                completing, for example, an on-call learning checklist), consider configuring your
                alerting system to copy incoming pages to your newbie, at first only during
                business hours. Rely on their curiosity to lead the way. These "shadow" on-call
                shifts are a great way for a mentor to gain visibility into a student’s progress,
                and for a student to gain visibility into the responsibilities of being on-call. By
                arranging for the newbie to shadow multiple members of their team, the team will
                become increasingly comfortable with the thought of this person entering the
                on-call rotation. Instilling confidence in this manner is an effective method of
                building trust, allowing more senior members to detach when they aren’t on-call,
                thus helping to avoid team burnout.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a page comes in, the new SRE is not the appointed on-caller, a condition which
                removes any time pressure for the student. They now have a front-row seat to the
                outage while it unfolds, rather than after the issue is resolved. It may be that
                the student and the primary on-caller share a terminal session, or sit near each
                other to readily compare notes. At a time of mutual convenience after the outage is
                complete, the on-caller can review the reasoning and processes followed for the
                student’s benefit. This exercise will increase the shadow on-caller’s retention of
                what actually <span class="keep-together">occurred</span>.
              </p>
              <div data-type="tip" id="id-baUphJcyi0">

                </h6>
                <p>
                  Should an outage occur for which writing a postmortem is beneficial, the
                  on-caller should include the newbie as a coauthor. <em>Do not dump the writeup
                  solely on the student, because it could be mislearned that postmortems are
                  somehow grunt work to be passed off on those most junior. It would be a mistake
                  to create such an impression.</em>

              </div>
              <p>
                Some teams will also include a final step: having the experienced on-caller
                "reverse shadow" the student. The newbie will become primary on-call and own all
                incoming escalations, but the experienced on-caller will lurk in the shadows,
                independently diagnosing the situation without modifying any state. The experienced
                SRE will be available to provide active support, help, validation, and hints as

              go on-call for their service. Some teams create a final exam of sorts that tests
              their students one last time before bestowing them with on-call powers and
              responsibilities. Other new SREs will submit their completion of the on-call learning
              checklist as evidence that they are ready. Regardless of how you gate this milestone,
              going on-call is a rite of passage and it should be celebrated as a team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Does learning stop when a student joins the ranks of on-call? Of course not! To
              remain vigilant as SREs, your team will always need to be active and aware of changes
              to come. While your attention is elsewhere, portions of your stack may be
              rearchitected and extended, leaving your team’s operational knowledge as historic at
              best.
            </p>
            <p>
              Set up a regular learning series for your whole team, where overviews of new and
              upcoming changes to your stack are given as presentations by the SREs who are
              shepherding the changes, who can co-present with developers as needed. If you can,
              record the presentations so that you can build a training library for future
              students.
            </p>
            <p>
              With some practice, you’ll gain much timely involvement from both SREs within your
              team and developers who work closely with your team, all while keeping everyone’s
              minds fresh about the future. There are other venues for educational engagement, too:
              consider having SREs give talks to your developer counterparts. The better your
              development peers understand your work and the challenges your team faces, the easier
              it will be to reach fully informed decisions on later projects.

              both for the students eager to grasp their production environment and for the teams
              grateful to welcome students into the ranks of on-call. Through the use of applicable
              practices outlined in this chapter, you will create well-rounded SREs faster, while
              sharpening team skills in perpetuity. How you apply these practices is up to you, but
              the charge is clear: as SRE, you have to scale your humans faster than you scale your
              machines. Good luck to you and your teams in creating a culture of learning and
              teaching!
