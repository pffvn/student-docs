          </p>
          <p>
            <a data-primary="interrupts" data-secondary="dealing with" data-type="indexterm" id=
            "id-vgCPSwtJ"></a>“Operational load,” when applied to complex systems, is the work that
            must be done to maintain the system in a functional state. For example, if you own a
            car, you (or someone you pay) always end up servicing it, putting gas in it, or doing
            other regular maintenance to keep it performing its function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any complex system is as imperfect as its creators. In managing the operational load
            created by these systems, remember that its creators are also imperfect machines.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Operational load</em>, <a data-primary="operational load" data-secondary="types of"
            data-type="indexterm" id="id-NnC7FjTL"></a>when applied to managing complex systems,
            takes many forms, some more obvious than others. The terminology may change, but
            operational load falls into three general categories: pages, tickets, and ongoing
            operational activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Pages</em> concern production alerts and their fallout, and are triggered in
            response to production emergencies. They can sometimes be monotonous and recurring,
            requiring little thought. They can also be engaging and involve tactical in-depth
            thought. Pages always have an expected response time (SLO), which is sometimes measured
            in minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Tickets</em> concern customer requests that require you to take an action. Like
            pages, tickets can be either simple and boring, or require real thought. A simple
            ticket might request a code review for a config the team owns. A more complex ticket
            might entail a special or unusual request for help with a design or capacity plan.
            Tickets may also have an SLO, but response time is more likely measured in hours, days,
            or weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Ongoing operational responsibilities</em> (also known as "Kicking the can down the
            road" and "toil"; see <a data-type="xref" href=
            "eliminating-toil.html">Eliminating Toil</a>) include activities
            like team-owned code or flag rollouts, or responses to ad hoc, time-sensitive questions
            from customers. While they may not have a defined SLO, these tasks can interrupt you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some types of operational load are easily anticipated or planned for, but much of the
            load is unplanned, or can interrupt someone at a nonspecific time, requiring that
            person to determine if the issue can wait.

              <a data-primary="operational load" data-secondary="managing" data-type="indexterm"

              "managing operational load" data-type="indexterm" id="id-7nCOFgFjCl"></a>Google has
              several methods of managing each type of operational load at the team level.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Pages</em> are most commonly managed by a dedicated primary on-call engineer.
              This is a single person who responds to pages and manages the resulting incidents or
              outages. The primary on-call engineer might also manage user support communications,
              escalation to product developers, and so on. In order to both minimize the
              interruption a page causes to a team and avoid the bystander effect, Google on-call
              shifts are manned by a single engineer. The on-call engineer might escalate pages to
              another team member if a problem isn’t well understood.
            </p>
            <p>
              Typically, a secondary on-call engineer acts as a backup for the primary. The
              secondary engineer’s duties vary. In some rotations, the secondary’s only duty is to
              contact the primary if pages fall through. In this case, the secondary might be on
              another team. The secondary engineer may or may not consider themselves <em>on
              interrupts</em>, depending on duties.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Tickets</em> are managed in a few different ways, depending on the SRE team: a
              primary on-call engineer might work on tickets while on-call, a secondary engineer
              might work on tickets while on-call, or a team can have a dedicated ticket person who
              is <em>not</em> on-call. Tickets might be randomly autodistributed among team
              members, or team members might be expected to service tickets ad hoc.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Ongoing operational responsibilities</em> <a data-primary="operational load"
              data-secondary="ongoing responsibilities" data-type="indexterm" id=
              "id-KnCdFnTVCW"></a>are also managed in varying ways. Sometimes, the on-call engineer
              does the work (pushes, flag flips, etc.). Alternately, each responsibility can be
              assigned to team members ad hoc, or an on-call engineer might pick up a lasting
              responsibility (i.e., a multiweek rollout or ticket) that lasts beyond their shift
              week.

              Factors in Determining How Interrupts Are Handled

              data-type="indexterm" id="id-7nCJSgFVsl"></a>To take a step back from the mechanics
              of how operational load is managed, there are a number of metrics that factor into
              how each of these interrupts are handled. Some SRE teams at Google have found the
              following metrics to be useful in deciding how to manage interrupts:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Interrupt SLO or expected response time
              </li>
              <li>The number of interrupts that are usually backlogged
              </li>
              <li>The severity of the interrupts
              </li>
              <li>The frequency of the interrupts
              </li>
              <li>The number of people available to handle a certain kind of interrupt (e.g., some
              teams require a certain amount of ticket work before going on-call)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You might notice that all of these metrics are suited to meeting the lowest possible
              response time, without factoring in more human costs. Trying to take stock of the
              human and productivity cost is difficult.

              Humans are imperfect machines. They get bored, they have processors (and sometimes
              UIs) that aren’t very well understood, and they aren’t very efficient. Recognizing
              the human element as "Working as Intended" and trying to work around or ameliorate
              how humans work could fill a much larger space than provided here; for the moment,
              some basic ideas might be useful in determining how interrupts should work.

                "id-qpMuvt4FlIDHv-marker">143</a></sup> is widely accepted and can be empirically
                acknowledged by pretty much everyone who works in Software Engineering, Sysadmin,
                SRE, or most other disciplines that require focused periods of concentration. Being
                in "the zone" can increase productivity, but can also increase artistic and
                scientific creativity. Achieving this state encourages people to actually master
                and improve the task or project they’re working on. Being interrupted can kick you
                right out of this state, if the interrupt is disruptive enough. You want to
                maximize the amount of time spent in this state.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cognitive flow can also apply to less creative pursuits where the skill level
                required is lower, and the essential elements of flow are still fulfilled (clear
                goals, immediate feedback, a sense of control, and the associated time distortion);
                examples include housework or driving.

                You can get in the zone by working on low-skill, low-difficulty problems, such as
                playing a repetitive video game. You can just as easily get there by doing
                high-skill, high-difficulty problems, such as those an engineer might face. The
                methods of arriving at a cognitive flow state differ, but the outcome is
                essentially the same.

                  Cognitive flow state: Creative and engaged
                </h3>
                <p>
                  This is the zone: someone works on a problem for a while, is aware of and
                  comfortable with the parameters of the problem, and feels like they can fix it or
                  solve it. The person works intently on the problem, losing track of time and
                  ignoring interrupts as much as possible. Maximizing the amount of time a person
                  can spend in this state is very desirable—they’re going to produce creative
                  results and do good work by volume. They’ll be happier at the job they’re doing.

                  Unfortunately, many people in SRE-type roles spend much of their time either
                  trying and failing to get into this mode and getting frustrated when they cannot,
                  or never even attempting to reach this mode, instead languishing in the
                  interrupted state.

                  Cognitive flow state: Angry Birds

                <p>
                  People enjoy performing tasks they know how to do. In fact, executing such tasks
                  is one of the clearest paths to cognitive flow. Some SREs are on-call when they
                  reach a state of cognitive flow. It can be very fulfilling to chase down the
                  causes of problems, work with others, and improve the overall health of the
                  system in such a tangible way. Conversely, for most stressed-out on-call
                  engineers, stress is caused either by pager volume, or because they’re treating
                  on-call as an interrupt. They’re trying to code or work on projects while
                  simultaneously being on-call or on full-time interrupts. These engineers exist in
                  a state of constant interruption, or <em>interruptability</em>. This working
                  environment is extremely stressful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, when a person is concentrating full-time on interrupts,
                  <em>interrupts stop being interrupts</em>. At a very visceral level, making
                  incremental improvements to the system, whacking tickets, and fixing problems and
                  outages becomes a clear set of goals, boundaries, and clear feedback: you close X
                  bugs, or you stop getting paged. All that’s left is distractions. <em>When you’re
                  doing interrupts, your projects are a distraction</em>. Even though interrupts
                  may be a satisfying use of time in the short term, in a mixed project/on-call
                  environment, people are ultimately happier with a balance between these two types
                  of work. The ideal balance varies from engineer to engineer. It’s important to be
                  aware that some engineers may not actually know what balance best motivates them
                  (or might think they know, but you may disagree).

                The following suggestions, based on what’s worked for various SRE teams that I’ve
                managed at Google, are mainly for the benefit of team managers or influencers. This
                document is agnostic to personal habits—people are free to manage their own time as
                they see fit. The concentration here is on directing the structure of how the team
                itself manages interrupts, so that people aren’t set up for failure because of team
                function or structure.

                  data-type="indexterm" id="id-AnCDFZFVtXt8Hz"></a>The ways in which an engineer
                  may be distracted and therefore prevented from achieving a state of cognitive
                  flow are numerous. For example: consider a random SRE named Fred. Fred comes into
                  work on Monday morning. Fred isn’t on-call or on interrupts today, so Fred would
                  clearly like to work on his projects. He grabs a coffee, sticks on his "do not
                  disturb" headphones, and sits at his desk. Zone time, right?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Except, at any time, any of the following things might happen:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Fred’s team uses an automated ticket system to randomly assign tickets to the
                  team. A ticket gets assigned to him, due today.
                  </li>
                  <li>Fred’s colleague is on-call and receives a page about a component that Fred
                  is expert in, and interrupts him to ask about it.
                  </li>
                  <li>A user of Fred’s service raises the priority of a ticket that’s been assigned
                  to him since last week, when he was on-call.
                  </li>
                  <li>A flag rollout that’s rolling out over 3–4 weeks and is assigned to Fred goes
                  wrong, forcing Fred to drop everything to examine the rollout, roll back the
                  change, and so forth.
                  </li>
                  <li>A user of Fred’s service contacts Fred to ask a question, because Fred is
                  such a helpful chap.
                  </li>
                  <li>And so on.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The end result is that even though Fred has the entire calendar day free to work
                  on projects, he remains extremely distractible. Some of these distractions he can
                  manage himself by closing email, turning off IM, or taking other similar
                  measures. Some distractions are caused by policy, or by assumptions around
                  interrupts and ongoing responsibilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can claim that some level of distraction is inevitable and by design. This
                  assumption is correct: people do hang onto bugs for which they’re the primary
                  contact, and people also build up other responsibilities and obligations.
                  However, there are ways that a team can manage interrupt response so that more
                  people (on average) can come into work in the morning and <em>feel
                  undistractible</em>.

                  "indexterm" id="id-AnCPSZFnhXt8Hz"></a>In order to limit your distractibility,
                  you should try to minimize context switches. Some interrupts are inevitable.
                  However, viewing an engineer as an interruptible unit of work, whose context
                  switches are free, is suboptimal if you want people to be happy and productive.
                  Assign a cost to context switches. A 20-minute interruption while working on a
                  project entails two context switches; realistically, this interruption results in
                  a loss of a couple hours of truly productive work. To avoid constant occurrences
                  of productivity loss, aim for polarized time between work styles, with each work
                  period lasting as long as possible. Ideally, this time period is a week, but a
                  day or even a half-day may be more practical. This strategy also fits in with the
                  complementary concept of <em>make time</em> <a data-type="xref" href=
                  "bibliography.html#Gra09" target="_blank">[Gra09]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Polarizing time means that when a person comes into work each day, they should
                  know if they’re doing <em>just</em> project work or <em>just</em> interrupts.
                  Polarizing their time in this way means they get to concentrate for longer
                  periods of time on the task at hand. They don’t get stressed out because they’re
                  being roped into tasks that drag them away from the work they’re supposed to be
                  doing.

                  potentially apply to pages, too—the on-call can start bumping things to their
                  secondary, or downgrading pages to tickets.

                  solely on on-call work. If the pager is quiet for your service, tickets or other
                  interrupt-based work that can be abandoned fairly quickly should be part of
                  on-call duties. When an engineer is on-call for a week, that week should be
                  written off as far as project work is concerned. If a project is too important to
                  let slip by a week, that person shouldn’t be on-call. Escalate in order to assign
                  someone else to the on-call shift. <em>A person should never be expected to be
                  on-call and also make progress on projects (or anything else with a high context
                  switching cost)</em>.

                <p>
                  Secondary duties depend on how onerous those duties are. If the function of the
                  secondary is to back up the primary in the case of a fallthrough, then maybe you
                  can safely assume that the secondary can also accomplish project work. If someone
                  other than the secondary is assigned to handling tickets, consider merging the
                  roles. If the secondary is expected to actually help the primary in the case of
                  high pager volume, they should do interrupt work, too.

                  (Aside: <em>You never run out of cleanup work</em>. Your ticket count might be at
                  zero, but there is always documentation that needs updating, configs that need
                  cleanup, etc. Your future on-call engineers will thank you, and it means they’re
                  less likely to interrupt you during your precious make time).

                  Tickets should be a full-time role, for an amount of time that’s manageable for a

                  than can be closed by the primary and secondary on-call engineers combined, then
                  structure your ticket rotation to have two people handling tickets at any given
                  time. Don’t spread the load across the entire team. People are not machines, and
                  you’re just causing context switches that impact valuable flow time.

                  Sometimes when a person isn’t on interrupts, the team receives an interrupt that
                  the person is uniquely qualified to handle. While ideally this scenario should
                  never happen, it sometimes does. You should work to make such occurrences rare.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sometimes people work on tickets when they’re not assigned to handle tickets
                  because it’s an easy way to look busy. Such behavior isn’t helpful. It means the
                  person is less effective than they should be. They skew the numbers in terms of
                  how manageable the ticket load is. If one person is assigned to tickets, but two
                  or three other people also take a stab at the ticket queue, you might still have
                  an unmanageable ticket queue even though you don’t realize it.

                <p>
                  Lots of ticket rotations or on-call rotations function like a gauntlet. This is
                  especially true of rotations on larger teams. If you’re only on interrupts every
                  couple of months, it’s easy to run the gauntlet,<sup><a data-type="noteref" href=
                  "dealing-with-interrupts.html#id-YAJuDSYFvIyT7Hv" id="id-YAJuDSYFvIyT7Hv-marker">144</a></sup> heave a sigh
                  of relief, and then return to your regular duties. Your successor then does the
                  same, and the root causes of tickets are never investigated. Rather than
                  achieving forward movement, your team is bogged down by a succession of people
                  getting annoyed by the same issues.

                  There should be a handoff for tickets, as well as for on-call work. A handoff
                  process maintains shared state between ticket handlers as responsibility switches
                  over. Even some basic introspection into the root causes of interrupts can
                  provide good solutions for reducing the overall rate. <em>Lots</em> of teams
                  conduct on-call handoffs and page reviews. <em>Very few</em> teams do the same
                  for tickets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your team should conduct a regular scrub for tickets and pages, in which you
                  examine classes of interrupts to see if you can identify a root cause. If you
                  think the root cause is fixable in a reasonable amount of time, then <em>silence
                  the interrupts until the root cause is expected to be fixed</em>. Doing so
                  provides relief for the person handling interrupts and creates a handy deadline
                  enforcement for the person fixing the root cause.

                  Respect yourself, as well as your customers

                <p>
                  This maxim applies more to user interrupts than automated interrupts, although
                  the principles stand for both scenarios. If tickets are particularly annoying or
                  onerous to resolve, you can effectively use policy to mitigate the burden.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Remember:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Your team sets the level of service provided by your service.
                  </li>
                  <li>It’s OK to push back some of the effort onto your customers.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  If your team is responsible for handling tickets or interrupts for customers, you
                  can often use policy to make your work load more manageable. A policy fix can be
                  temporary or permanent, depending on what makes sense. Such a fix should strike a
                  good balance between respect for the customer and respect for yourself. Policy
                  can be as powerful a tool as code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if you support a particularly flaky tool that doesn’t have many
                  developer resources, and a small number of needy customers use it, consider other
                  options. Think about the value of the time you spend doing interrupts for this
                  system, and if you’re spending this time wisely. At some point, if you can’t get
                  the attention you need to fix the root cause of the problems causing interrupts,
                  perhaps the component you’re supporting isn’t that important. You should consider
                  giving the pager back, deprecating it, replacing it, or another strategy in this
                  vein that might make sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If there are particular steps for an interrupt that are time-consuming or tricky,
                  but don’t require your privileges to accomplish, consider using policy to push
                  the request back to the requestor. For example, if people need to donate compute
                  resources, prepare a code or config change or some similar step, and then
                  instruct the customer to execute that step and send it for your review. Remember
                  that if the customer wants a certain task to be accomplished, they should be
                  prepared to spend some effort getting what they want.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A caveat to the preceding solutions is that you need to find a balance between
                  respect for the customer and for yourself. Your guiding principle in constructing
                  a strategy for dealing with customer requests is that the request should be
                  meaningful, be rational, and provide all the information and legwork you need in
                  order to fulfill the request. In return, your response should be helpful and
                  timely.
