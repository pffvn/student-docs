          As SREs, we work with large-scale, complex, distributed systems. We constantly enhance
          our services with new features and add new systems. Incidents and outages are inevitable
          given our scale and velocity of change. When an incident occurs, we fix the underlying
          issue, and services return to their normal operating conditions. Unless we have some
          formalized process of learning from these incidents in place, they may recur ad
          infinitum. Left unchecked, incidents can multiply in complexity or even cascade,
          overwhelming a system and its operators and ultimately impacting our users. Therefore,
          postmortems are an essential tool for SRE.
        </p>
        <p>
          The postmortem concept is well known in the technology industry <a href=
          "bibliography.html#All12" target="_blank">[All12]</a>. A postmortem is
          a written record of an incident, its impact, the actions taken to mitigate or resolve it,
          the root cause(s), and the follow-up actions to prevent the incident from recurring. This
          chapter describes criteria for deciding when to conduct postmortems, some best practices
          around postmortems, and advice on how to cultivate a postmortem culture based on the
          experience we’ve gained over the years.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">
          Google’s Postmortem Philosophy
        </h1>
        <p>
          The primary goals of writing a postmortem are to ensure that the incident is documented,
          that all contributing root cause(s) are well understood, and, especially, that effective
          preventive actions are put in place to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of recurrence.
          A detailed survey of root-cause analysis techniques is beyond the scope of this chapter
          (instead, see <a href="bibliography.html#Roo04" target=
          "_blank">[Roo04]</a>); however, articles, best practices, and tools abound in the system
          quality domain. Our teams use a variety of techniques for root-cause analysis and choose
          the technique best suited to their services. Postmortems are expected after any
          significant undesirable event. Writing a postmortem is not punishment—it is a learning
          opportunity for the entire company. The postmortem process does present an inherent cost
          in terms of time or effort, so we are deliberate in choosing when to write one. Teams
          have some internal flexibility, but common postmortem triggers include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>User-visible downtime or degradation beyond a certain threshold
          </li>
          <li>Data loss of any kind
          </li>
          <li>On-call engineer intervention (release rollback, rerouting of traffic, etc.)
          </li>
          <li>A resolution time above some threshold
          </li>
          <li>A monitoring failure (which usually implies manual incident discovery)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is important to define postmortem criteria before an incident occurs so that everyone
          knows when a postmortem is necessary. In addition to these objective triggers, any
          stakeholder may request a postmortem for an event.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blameless postmortems are a tenet of SRE culture. For a postmortem to be truly blameless,
          it must focus on identifying the contributing causes of the incident without indicting
          any individual or team for bad or inappropriate behavior. A blamelessly written
          postmortem assumes that everyone involved in an incident had good intentions and did the
          right thing with the information they had. If a culture of finger pointing and shaming
          individuals or teams for doing the "wrong" thing prevails, people will not bring issues
          to light for fear of punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blameless culture originated in the healthcare and avionics industries where mistakes can
          be fatal. These industries nurture an environment where every "mistake" is seen as an
          opportunity to strengthen the system. When postmortems shift from allocating blame to
          investigating the systematic reasons why an individual or team had incomplete or
          incorrect information, effective prevention plans can be put in place. You can’t "fix"
          people, but you can fix systems and processes to better support people making the right
          choices when designing and maintaining complex systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          When an outage does occur, a postmortem is not written as a formality to be forgotten.
          Instead the postmortem is seen by engineers as an opportunity not only to fix a weakness,
          but to make Google more resilient as a whole. While a blameless postmortem doesn’t simply
          vent frustration by pointing fingers, it <em>should</em> call out where and how services
          can be improved. Here are two examples:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Pointing fingers
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              "We need to rewrite the entire complicated backend system! It’s been breaking weekly
              for the last three quarters and I’m sure we’re all tired of fixing things
              onesy-twosy. Seriously, if I get paged one more time I’ll rewrite it myself…"
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Blameless
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              "An action item to rewrite the entire backend system might actually prevent these
              annoying pages from continuing to happen, and the maintenance manual for this version
              is quite long and really difficult to be fully trained up on. I’m sure our future
              on-callers will thank us!"

        </dl>
        <h5 class="subheaders">
          Best Practice: Avoid Blame and Keep It Constructive
        </h5>
        <p>
          Blameless postmortems can be challenging to write, because the postmortem format clearly
          identifies the actions that led to the incident. Removing blame from a postmortem gives
          people the confidence to escalate issues without fear. It is also important not to
          stigmatize frequent production of postmortems by a person or team. An atmosphere of blame
          risks creating a culture in which incidents and issues are swept under the rug, leading
          to greater risk for the organization <a href="bibliography.html#Boy13"
          target="_blank">[Boy13]</a>.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">
          Collaborate and Share Knowledge
        </h1>
        <p>
          We value collaboration, and the postmortem process is no exception. The postmortem
          workflow includes collaboration and knowledge-sharing at every stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our postmortem documents are Google Docs, with an in-house template (see <a href=
          "postmortem.html">Example Postmortem</a>). Regardless of the specific
          tool you use, look for the following key features:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt class="italic">

              Can be directed at collaborators within the document or used to loop in others to
              provide input.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          Writing a postmortem also involves formal review and publication. In practice, teams
          share the first postmortem draft internally and solicit a group of senior engineers to
          assess the draft for completeness. Review criteria might include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Was key incident data collected for posterity?
          </li>
          <li>Are the impact assessments complete?
          </li>
          <li>Was the root cause sufficiently deep?
          </li>
          <li>Is the action plan appropriate and are resulting bug fixes at appropriate priority?
          </li>
          <li>Did we share the outcome with relevant stakeholders?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once the initial review is complete, the postmortem is shared more broadly, typically
          with the larger engineering team or on an internal mailing list. Our goal is to share
          postmortems to the widest possible audience that would benefit from the knowledge or
          lessons imparted. Google has stringent rules around access to any piece of information
          that might identify an end-user,<sup><a href="postmortem-culture.html#id-D04I1SPc1iK" id=
          "id-D04I1SPc1iK-marker">80</a></sup> and even internal documents like postmortems never
          include such information.
        </p>
        <h5 class="subheaders">
          Best Practice: No Postmortem Left Unreviewed
        </h5>
        <p>
          An unreviewed postmortem might as well never have existed. To ensure that each completed
          draft is reviewed, we encourage regular review sessions for postmortems. In these
          meetings, it is important to close out any ongoing discussions and comments, to capture
          ideas, and to finalize the state.
        </p>

          Once those involved are satisfied with the document and its action items, the postmortem
          is added to a team or organization repository of past incidents.<sup><a href=

          Introducing a Postmortem Culture
        </h1>
        <p>
          Introducing a postmortem culture to your organization is easier said than done; such an
          effort requires continuous cultivation and reinforcement. We reinforce a collaborative
          postmortem culture through senior management’s active participation in the review and
          collaboration process. Management can encourage this culture, but blameless postmortems
          are ideally the product of engineer self-motivation. In the spirit of nurturing the
          postmortem culture, SREs proactively create activities that disseminate what we learn
          about system infrastructure. Some example activities include:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Postmortem of the month
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              In a monthly newsletter, an interesting and well-written postmortem is shared with
              the entire organization.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Google+ postmortem group
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              This group shares and discusses internal and external postmortems, best practices,
              and commentary about postmortems.

            Postmortem reading clubs
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Teams host regular postmortem reading clubs, in which an interesting or impactful
              postmortem is brought to the table (along with some tasty refreshments) for an open
              dialogue with participants, nonparticipants, and new Googlers about what happened,
              what lessons the incident imparted, and the aftermath of the incident. Often, the
              postmortem being reviewed is months or years old!
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Wheel of Misfortune
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              New SREs are often treated to the Wheel of Misfortune exercise (see <a href=
              "accelerating-sre-on-call.html#xref_training_disaster-rpg">Disaster
              Role Playing</a>), in which a previous postmortem is reenacted with a cast of
              engineers playing roles as laid out in the postmortem. The original incident
              commander attends to help make the experience as "real" as possible.

        <p>
          One of the biggest challenges of introducing postmortems to an organization is that some
          may question their value given the cost of their preparation. The following strategies
          can help in facing this challenge:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ease postmortems into the workflow. A trial period with several complete and
          successful postmortems may help prove their value, in addition to helping to identify
          what criteria should initiate a postmortem.
          </li>
          <li>Make sure that writing effective postmortems is a rewarded and celebrated practice,
          both publicly through the social methods mentioned earlier, and through individual and
          team performance management.
          </li>
          <li>Encourage senior leadership’s acknowledgment and participation. Even Larry Page talks
          about the high value of postmortems!

          Best Practice: Visibly Reward People for Doing the Right Thing
        </h5>
        <p>
          Google’s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin host TGIF, a weekly all-hands held live at
          our headquarters in Mountain View, California, and broadcast to Google offices around the
          world. A 2014 TGIF focused on "The Art of the Postmortem," which featured SRE discussion
          of high-impact incidents. One SRE discussed a release he had recently pushed; despite
          thorough testing, an unexpected interaction inadvertently took down a critical service
          for four minutes. The incident only lasted four minutes because the SRE had the presence
          of mind to roll back the change immediately, averting a much longer and larger-scale
          outage. Not only did this engineer receive two peer bonuses<sup><a href=
          "postmortem-culture.html#id-JJ7umIlF2Tyuq" id="id-JJ7umIlF2Tyuq-marker">82</a></sup> immediately afterward in
          recognition of his quick and level-headed handling of the incident, but he also received
          a huge round of applause from the TGIF audience, which included the company’s founders
          and an audience of Googlers numbering in the thousands. In addition to such a visible
          forum, Google has an array of internal social networks that drive peer praise toward
          well-written postmortems and exceptional incident handling. This is one example of many
          where recognition of these contributions comes from peers, CEOs, and everyone in
          between.<sup><a href="postmortem-culture.html#id-9vbuDtvF7TXuQ" id="id-9vbuDtvF7TXuQ-marker">83</a></sup>

          Best Practice: Ask for Feedback on Postmortem Effectiveness
        </h5>
        <p>
          At Google, we strive to address problems as they arise and share innovations internally.
          We regularly survey our teams on how the postmortem process is supporting their goals and
          how the process might be improved. We ask questions such as: Is the culture supporting
          your work? Does writing a postmortem entail too much toil (see <a href=
          "eliminating-toil.html">Eliminating Toil</a>)? What best practices
          does your team recommend for other teams? What kinds of tools would you like to see
          developed? The survey results give the SREs in the trenches the opportunity to ask for
          improvements that will increase the effectiveness of the postmortem culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the operational aspects of incident management and follow-up, postmortem practice
          has been woven into the culture at Google: it’s now a cultural norm that any significant
          incident is followed by a comprehensive postmortem.

        <h1 class="heading">
          Conclusion and Ongoing Improvements
        </h1>
        <p>
          We can say with confidence that thanks to our continuous investment in cultivating a
          postmortem culture, Google weathers fewer outages and fosters a better user experience.
          Our "Postmortems at Google" working group is one example of our commitment to the culture
          of blameless postmortems. This group coordinates postmortem efforts across the company:
          pulling together postmortem templates, automating postmortem creation with data from
          tools used during an incident, and helping automate data extraction from postmortems so
          we can perform trend analysis. We’ve been able to collaborate on best practices from
          products as disparate as YouTube, Google Fiber, Gmail, Google Cloud, AdWords, and Google
          Maps. While these products are quite diverse, they all conduct postmortems with the
          universal goal of learning from our darkest hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a large number of postmortems produced each month across Google, tools to aggregate
          postmortems are becoming more and more useful. These tools help us identify common themes
          and areas for improvement across product boundaries. To facilitate comprehension and
          automated analysis, we have recently enhanced our postmortem template (see <a href=
          "postmortem.html">Example Postmortem</a>) with additional metadata
          fields. Future work in this domain includes machine learning to help predict our
          weaknesses, facilitate real-time incident investigation, and reduce duplicate incidents.
