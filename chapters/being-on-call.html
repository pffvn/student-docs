        <p>
          Being on-call is a critical duty that many operations and engineering teams must
          undertake in order to keep their services reliable and available. However, there are
          several pitfalls in the organization of on-call rotations and responsibilities that can
          lead to serious consequences for the services and for the teams if not avoided. This
          chapter describes the primary tenets of the approach to on-call that Googleâ€™s Site
          Reliability Engineers (SREs) have developed over years, and explains how that approach
          has led to reliable services and sustainable workload over time.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">
          Introduction
        </h1>
        <p>
          Several professions require employees to perform some sort of on-call duty, which entails
          being available for calls during both working and nonworking hours. In the IT context,
          on-call activities have historically been performed by dedicated Ops teams tasked with
          the primary responsibility of keeping the service(s) for which they are responsible in
          good health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many important services in Google, e.g., Search, Ads, and Gmail, have dedicated teams of
          SREs responsible for the performance and reliability of these services. Thus, SREs are
          on-call for the services they support. The SRE teams are quite different from purely
          operational teams in that they place heavy emphasis on the use of engineering to approach
          problems. These problems, which typically fall in the operational domain, exist at a
          scale that would be intractable without software engineering <span>solutions</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enforce this type of problem solving, Google hires people with a diverse background in
          systems and software engineering into SRE teams. We cap the amount of time SREs spend on
          purely operational work at 50%; at minimum, 50% of an SREâ€™s time should be allocated to
          engineering projects that further scale the impact of the team through automation, in
          addition to improving the service.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">
          Life of an On-Call Engineer
        </h1>
        <p>
          This section describes the typical activities of an on-call engineer and provides some
          background for the rest of the chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the guardians of production systems, on-call engineers take care of their assigned
          operations by managing outages that affect the team and performing and/or vetting
          production changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          When on-call, an engineer is available to perform operations on production systems within
          minutes, according to the paging response times agreed to by the team and the business
          system owners. Typical values are 5 minutes for user-facing or otherwise highly
          time-critical services, and 30 minutes for less time-sensitive systems. The company
          provides the page-receiving device, which is typically a phone. Google has flexible alert
          delivery systems that can dispatch pages via multiple mechanisms (email, SMS, robot call,
          app) across multiple devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Response times are related to desired service availability, as demonstrated by the
          following simplistic example: if a user-facing system must obtain 4 nines of availability
          in a given quarter (99.99%), the allowed quarterly downtime is around 13 minutes
          (<a href="availability-table.html#appendix_table-of-nines">Availability
          Table</a>). This constraint implies that the reaction time of on-call engineers has to be
          in the order of minutes (strictly speaking, 13 minutes). For systems with more relaxed
          SLOs, the reaction time can be on the order of tens of minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as a page is received and acknowledged, the on-call engineer is expected to
          triage the problem and work toward its resolution, possibly involving other team members
          and escalating as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonpaging production events, such as lower priority alerts or software releases, can also
          be handled and/or vetted by the on-call engineer during business hours. These activities
          are less urgent than paging events, which take priority over almost every other task,
          including project work. For more insight on interrupts and other non-paging events that
          contribute to operational load, see <a href=
          "dealing-with-interrupts.html">Dealing with Interrupts</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many teams have both a primary and a secondary on-call rotation. The distribution of
          duties between the primary and the secondary varies from team to team. One team might
          employ the secondary as a fall-through for the pages the primary on-call misses. Another
          team might specify that the primary on-call handles only pages, while the secondary
          handles all other non-urgent production activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In teams for which a secondary rotation is not strictly required for duty distribution,
          it is common for two related teams to serve as secondary on-call for each other, with
          fall-through handling duties. This setup eliminates the need for an exclusive secondary
          on-call rotation.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many ways to organize on-call rotations; for detailed analysis, refer to the
          "Oncall" chapter of <a href="bibliography.html#Lim14" target=
          "_blank">[Lim14]</a>.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading" id="xref_oncall-engineer_balanced-oncall">
          Balanced On-Call
        </h1>
        <p>
          SRE teams have specific constraints on the quantity and quality of on-call shifts. The
          quantity of on-call can be calculated by the percent of time spent by engineers on
          on-call duties. The quality of on-call can be calculated by the number of incidents that
          occur during an on-call shift.
        </p>
        <p>
          SRE managers have the responsibility of keeping the on-call workload balanced and
          sustainable across these two axes.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheaders">
          Balance in Quantity
        </h2>
        <p>
          We strongly believe that the "E" in "SRE" is a defining characteristic of our
          organization, so we strive to invest at least 50% of SRE time into engineering: of the
          remainder, no more than 25% can be spent on-call, leaving up to another 25% on other
          types of operational, nonproject work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the 25% on-call rule, we can derive the minimum number of SREs required to sustain
          a 24/7 on-call rotation. Assuming that there are always two people on-call (primary and
          secondary, with different duties), the minimum number of engineers needed for on-call
          duty from a single-site team is eight: assuming week-long shifts, each engineer is
          on-call (primary or secondary) for one week every month. For dual-site teams, a
          reasonable minimum size of each team is six, both to honor the 25% rule and to ensure a
          substantial and critical mass of engineers for the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a service entails enough work to justify growing a single-site team, we prefer to
          create a multi-site team. A multi-site team is advantageous for two reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Night shifts have detrimental effects on peopleâ€™s health <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Dur05" target="_blank">[Dur05]</a>, and a
          multi-site "follow the sun" rotation allows teams to avoid night shifts altogether.
          </li>
          <li>Limiting the number of engineers in the on-call rotation ensures that engineers do
          not lose touch with the production systems (see <a href="being-on-call.html#xref_oncall_underload">A
          Treacherous Enemy: Operational Underload</a>).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, multi-site teams incur communication and coordination overhead. Therefore, the
          decision to go multi-site or single-site should be based upon the trade-offs each option
          entails, the importance of the system, and the workload each system
          <span>generates</span>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheaders">
          Balance in Quality
        </h2>
        <p>
          For each on-call shift, an engineer should have sufficient time to deal with any
          incidents and follow-up activities such as writing postmortems <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Loo10" target="_blank">[Loo10]</a>. Letâ€™s define an
          incident as a sequence of events and alerts that are related to the same root cause and
          would be discussed as part of the same postmortem. Weâ€™ve found that on average, dealing
          with the tasks involved in an on-call incidentâ€”root-cause analysis, remediation, and
          follow-up activities like writing a postmortem and fixing bugsâ€”takes 6 hours. It follows
          that the maximum number of incidents per day is 2 per 12-hour on-call shift. In order to
          stay within this upper bound, the distribution of paging events should be very flat over
          time, with a likely median value of 0: if a given component or issue causes pages every
          day (median incidents/day &gt; 1), it is likely that something else will break at some
          point, thus causing more incidents than should be permitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this limit is temporarily exceeded, e.g., for a quarter, corrective measures should be
          put in place to make sure that the operational load returns to a sustainable state (see
          <a href="being-on-call.html#xref_oncall_overload">Operational Overload</a> and <a href=
          "operational-overload.html">Embedding an SRE to Recover from
          Operational Overload</a>).
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheaders">
          Compensation
        </h2>
        <p>
          Adequate compensation needs to be considered for out-of-hours support. Different
          organizations handle on-call compensation in different ways; Google offers
          time-off-in-lieu or straight cash compensation, capped at some proportion of overall
          salary. The compensation cap represents, in practice, a limit on the amount of on-call
          work that will be taken on by any individual. This compensation structure ensures
          incentivization to be involved in on-call duties as required by the team, but also
          promotes a balanced on-call work distribution and limits potential drawbacks of excessive
          on-call work, such as burnout or inadequate time for project work.

          As mentioned earlier, SRE teams support Googleâ€™s most critical systems. Being an SRE
          on-call typically means assuming responsibility for user-facing, revenue-critical systems
          or for the infrastructure required to keep these systems up and running. SRE methodology
          for thinking about and tackling problems is vital for the appropriate operation of
          services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern research identifies two distinct ways of thinking that an individual may,
          consciously or subconsciously, choose when faced with challenges <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Kah11" target="_blank">[Kah11]</a>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Intuitive, automatic, and rapid action
          </li>
          <li>Rational, focused, and deliberate cognitive functions
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When one is dealing with the outages related to complex systems, the second of these
          options is more likely to produce better results and lead to well-planned incident
          handling.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make sure that the engineers are in the appropriate frame of mind to leverage the
          latter mindset, itâ€™s important to reduce the stress related to being on-call. The
          importance and the impact of the services and the consequences of potential outages can
          create significant pressure on the on-call engineers, damaging the well-being of
          individual team members and possibly prompting SREs to make incorrect choices that can
          endanger the availability of the service. Stress hormones like cortisol and
          corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) are known to cause behavioral
          consequencesâ€”including fearâ€”that can impair cognitive functions and cause suboptimal
          decision making <a href="bibliography.html#Chr09" target=
          "_blank">[Chr09]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the influence of these stress hormones, the more deliberate cognitive approach is
          typically subsumed by unreflective and unconsidered (but immediate) action, leading to
          potential abuse of heuristics. Heuristics are very tempting behaviors when one is
          on-call. For example, when the same alert pages for the fourth time in the week, and the
          previous three pages were initiated by an external infrastructure system, it is extremely
          tempting to exercise confirmation bias by automatically associating this fourth
          occurrence of the problem with the previous cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          While intuition and quick reactions can seem like desirable traits in the middle of
          incident management, they have downsides. Intuition can be wrong and is often less
          supportable by obvious data. Thus, following intuition can lead an engineer to waste time
          pursuing a line of reasoning that is incorrect from the start. Quick reactions are
          deep-rooted in habit, and habitual responses are unconsidered, which means they can be
          disastrous. The ideal methodology in incident management strikes the perfect balance of
          taking steps at the desired pace when enough data is available to make a reasonable
          decision while simultaneously critically examining your assumptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Itâ€™s important that on-call SREs understand that they can rely on several resources that
          make the experience of being on-call less daunting than it may seem. The most important
          on-call resources are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear escalation paths
          </li>
          <li>Well-defined incident-management procedures
          </li>
          <li>A blameless postmortem culture (<a href="bibliography.html#Loo10"
            target="_blank">[Loo10]</a>, <a href="bibliography.html#All12"
            target="_blank">[All12]</a>)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The developer teams of SRE-supported systems usually participate in a 24/7 on-call
          rotation, and it is always possible to escalate to these partner teams when necessary.
          The appropriate escalation of outages is generally a principled way to react to serious
          outages with significant unknown dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When one is handling incidents, if the issue is complex enough to involve multiple teams
          or if, after some investigation, it is not yet possible to estimate an upper bound for
          the incidentâ€™s time span, it can be useful to adopt a formal incident-management
          protocol. Google SRE uses the protocol described in <a href=
          "managing-incidents.html">Managing Incidents</a>, which offers an
          easy-to-follow and well-defined set of steps that aid an on-call engineer to rationally
          pursue a satisfactory incident resolution with all the required help. This protocol is
          internally supported by a web-based tool that automates most of the incident management
          actions, such as handing off roles and recording and communicating status updates. This
          tool allows incident managers to focus on dealing with the incident, rather than spending
          time and cognitive effort on mundane actions such as formatting emails or updating
          several communication channels at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, when an incident occurs, itâ€™s important to evaluate what went wrong, recognize
          what went well, and take action to prevent the same errors from recurring in the future.
          SRE teams must write postmortems after significant incidents and detail a full timeline
          of the events that occurred. By focusing on events rather than the people, these
          postmortems provide significant value. Rather than placing blame on individuals, they
          derive value from the systematic analysis of production incidents. Mistakes happen, and
          software should make sure that we make as few mistakes as possible. Recognizing
          automation opportunities is one of the best ways to prevent human errors <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Loo10" target="_blank">[Loo10]</a>.

          Avoiding Inappropriate Operational Load
        </h1>
        <p>
          As mentioned in <a href="being-on-call.html#xref_oncall-engineer_balanced-oncall">Balanced On-Call</a>,
          SREs spend at most 50% of their time on operational work. What happens if operational
          activities exceed this limit?
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheaders" id="xref_oncall_overload">
          Operational Overload
        </h2>
        <p>
          The SRE team and leadership are responsible for including concrete objectives in
          quarterly work planning in order to make sure that the workload returns to sustainable
          levels. Temporarily loaning an experienced SRE to an overloaded team, discussed in
          <a href="operational-overload.html">Embedding an SRE to Recover from
          Operational Overload</a>, can provide enough breathing room so that the team can make
          headway in addressing issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally, symptoms of operational overload should be measurable, so that the goals can be
          quantified (e.g., number of daily tickets &lt; 5, paging events per shift &lt; 2).
        </p>
        <p>
          Misconfigured monitoring is a common cause of operational overload. Paging alerts should
          be aligned with the symptoms that threaten a serviceâ€™s SLOs. All paging alerts should
          also be actionable. Low-priority alerts that bother the on-call engineer every hour (or
          more frequently) disrupt productivity, and the fatigue such alerts induce can also cause
          serious alerts to be treated with less attention than necessary.See <a href=
          "dealing-with-interrupts.html">Dealing with Interrupts</a> for further
          discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also important to control the number of alerts that the on-call engineers receive
          for a single incident. Sometimes a single abnormal condition can generate several alerts,
          so itâ€™s important to regulate the alert fan-out by ensuring that related alerts are
          grouped together by the monitoring or alerting system. If, for any reason, duplicate or
          uninformative alerts are generated during an incident, silencing those alerts can provide
          the necessary quiet for the on-call engineer to focus on the incident itself. Noisy
          alerts that systematically generate more than one alert per incident should be tweaked to
          approach a 1:1 alert/incident ratio. Doing so allows the on-call engineer to focus on the
          incident instead of triaging duplicate alerts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the changes that cause operational overload are not under the control of the
          SRE teams. For example, the application developers might introduce changes that cause the
          system to be more noisy, less reliable, or both. In this case, it is appropriate to work
          together with the application developers to set common goals to improve the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          In extreme cases, SRE teams may have the option to "give back the pager"â€”SRE can ask the
          developer team to be exclusively on-call for the system until it meets the standards of
          the SRE team in question. Giving back the pager doesnâ€™t happen very frequently, because
          itâ€™s almost always possible to work with the developer team to reduce the operational
          load and make a given system more reliable. In some cases, though, complex or
          architectural changes spanning multiple quarters might be required to make a system
          sustainable from an operational point of view. In such cases, the SRE team should not be
          subject to an excessive operational load. Instead, it is appropriate to negotiate the
          reorganization of on-call responsibilities with the development team, possibly routing
          some or all paging alerts to the developer on-call. Such a solution is typically a
          temporary measure, during which time the SRE and developer teams work together to get the
          service in shape to be on-boarded by the SRE team again.
        </p>
        <p>
          The possibility of renegotiating on-call responsibilities between SRE and product
          development teams attests to the balance of powers between the teams.<sup><a href=
          "being-on-call.html#id-D04I1SVigIauO" id="id-D04I1SVigIauO-marker">57</a></sup> This working relationship
          also exemplifies how the healthy tension between these two teams and the values that they
          representâ€”reliability versus feature velocityâ€”is typically resolved by greatly benefiting
          the service and, by extension, the company as a whole.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheaders" id="xref_oncall_underload">
          A Treacherous Enemy: Operational Underload
        </h2>
        <p>
          Being on-call for a quiet system is blissful, but what happens if the system is too quiet
          or when SREs are not on-call often enough? An operational underload is undesirable for an
          SRE team. Being out of touch with production for long periods of time can lead to
          confidence issues, both in terms of overconfidence and underconfidence, while knowledge
          gaps are discovered only when an incident occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          To counteract this eventuality, SRE teams should be sized to allow every engineer to be
          on-call at least once or twice a quarter, thus ensuring that each team member is
          sufficiently exposed to production. "Wheel of Misfortune" exercises (discussed in
          <a href="accelerating-sre-on-call.html">Accelerating SREs to On-Call
          and Beyond</a>) are also useful team activities that can help to hone and improve
          troubleshooting skills and knowledge of the service. Google also has a company-wide
          annual disaster recovery event called DiRT (Disaster Recovery Training) that combines
          theoretical and practical drills to perform multiday testing of infrastructure systems
          and individual services; see <a href="bibliography.html#Kri12" target=

          Conclusions
        </h1>
        <p>
          The approach to on-call described in this chapter serves as a guideline for all SRE teams
          in Google and is key to fostering a sustainable and manageable work environment. Googleâ€™s
          approach to on-call has enabled us to use engineering work as the primary means to scale
          production responsibilities and maintain high reliability and availability despite the
          increasing complexity and number of systems and services for which SREs are responsible.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this approach might not be immediately applicable to all contexts in which
          engineers need to be on-call for IT services, we believe it represents a solid model that
          organizations can adopt in scaling to meet a growing volume of on-call work.
