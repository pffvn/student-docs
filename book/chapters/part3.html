              <a id="id-DnC1SZSwFq"></a>Put simply, SREs run services—a set of related systems,
              operated for users, who may be internal or external—and are ultimately responsible
              for the health of these services. Successfully operating a service entails a wide
              range of activities: developing monitoring systems, planning capacity, responding to
              incidents, ensuring the root causes of outages are addressed, and so on. This section
              addresses the theory and practice of an SRE’s day-to-day activity: building and
              operating large distributed computing systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="id-kVCkSpFLFd"></a>We can characterize the health of a service—in much the
              same way that Abraham Maslow categorized human needs <a href=
              "bibliography.html#Mas43" target="_blank">[Mas43]</a>—from the
              most basic requirements needed for a system to function as a service at all to the
              higher levels of function—permitting self-actualization and taking active control of
              the direction of the service rather than reactively fighting fires. This
              understanding is so fundamental to how we evaluate services at Google that it wasn’t
              explicitly developed until a number of Google SREs, including our former colleague
              Mikey Dickerson,<sup><a href="part3.html#id-dA2uaIyFqF4" id=
              "id-dA2uaIyFqF4-marker">41</a></sup> temporarily joined the radically different
              culture of the United States government to help with the launch of
              <em>healthcare.gov</em> in late 2013 and early 2014: they needed a way to explain how
              to increase systems’ reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="id-4nCqSAIVFe"></a>We’ll use this hierarchy, illustrated in <a href=

              that go into making a service reliable, from most basic to most advanced.

              Monitoring
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="id-ZbCxSpTXFB"></a>Without monitoring, you have no way to tell whether the
              service is even working; absent a thoughtfully designed monitoring infrastructure,
              you’re flying blind. Maybe everyone who tries to use the website gets an error, maybe
              not—but you want to be aware of problems before your users notice them. We discuss
              tools and philosophy in <a href=
              "practical-alerting.html">Practical Alerting from Time-Series
              Data</a>.

            <p>
              <a id="id-yYCAS7i9F1"></a><a id="id-VMCpFJiXF1"></a>SREs don’t go on-call merely for
              the sake of it: rather, on-call support is a tool we use to achieve our larger
              mission and remain in touch with how distributed computing systems actually work (and
              fail!). If we could find a way to relieve ourselves of carrying a pager, we would. In
              <a href="being-on-call.html">Being On-Call</a>, we explain how we
              balance on-call duties with our other responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you’re aware that there is a problem, how do you make it go away? That doesn’t
              necessarily mean fixing it once and for all—maybe you can stop the bleeding by
              reducing the system’s precision or turning off some features temporarily, allowing it
              to gracefully degrade, or maybe you can direct traffic to another instance of the
              service that’s working properly. The details of the solution you choose to implement
              are necessarily specific to your service and your organization. Responding
              effectively to incidents, however, is something applicable to all teams.
            </p>
            <p>
              Figuring out what’s wrong is the first step; we offer a structured approach in
              <a href="effective-troubleshooting.html" target="_self">Effective
              Troubleshooting</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              During an incident, it’s often tempting to give in to adrenalin and start responding
              ad hoc. We advise against this temptation in <a href=
              "emergency-response.html" target="_self">Emergency Response</a>,
              and counsel in <a href="managing-incidents.html" target=
              "_self">Managing Incidents</a>, that managing incidents effectively should reduce
              their impact and limit outage-induced anxiety.

              <a id="id-PnCpSYHgF0"></a><a id="id-OnCLFXHDF1"></a>We aim to be alerted on and
              manually solve only new and exciting problems presented by our service; it’s woefully
              boring to "fix" the same issue over and over. In fact, this mindset is one of the key
              differentiators between the SRE philosophy and some more traditional
              operations-focused environments. This theme is explored in two chapters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Building a blameless postmortem culture is the first step in understanding what went
              wrong (and what went right!), as described in <a href=

              Related to that discussion, in <a href="tracking-outages.html"
              target="_self">Tracking Outages</a>, we briefly describe an internal tool, the outage
              tracker, that allows SRE teams to keep track of recent production incidents, their
              causes, and actions taken in response to them.

              attempting to prevent it, because an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
              Test suites offer some assurance that our software isn’t making certain classes of
              errors before it’s released to production; we talk about how best to use these in

            </p>
            <p>
              Naturally following capacity planning, load balancing ensures we’re properly using
              the capacity we’ve built. We discuss how requests to our services get sent to
              datacenters in <a href="load-balancing-frontend.html" target=

              Finally, in <a href="addressing-cascading-failures.html" target=

              can take: from one-shot MapReduce jobs running periodically to systems that operate
              in near real-time. Different architectures can lead to surprising and
              counterintuitive challenges.

              discussed previously, testing is subtle, and its improper execution can have large
              effects on overall stability. In an ACM article <a href=
              "bibliography.html#Kri12" target="_blank">[Kri12]</a>, we explain
              how Google performs <em>company-wide</em> resilience testing to ensure we’re capable
              of weathering the unexpected should a zombie apocalypse or other disaster strike.

              and as <a href="bibliography.html#Hix15a" target=

              security is detailed in <a href="bibliography.html#War14" target=
