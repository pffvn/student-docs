            story of scaling up. It is one of the great success stories of the computing industry,
            marking a shift towards IT-centric business. Google was one of the first companies to
            define what business-IT alignment meant in practice, and went on to inform the concept
            of DevOps for a wider IT community. This book has been written by a broad cross-section
            of the very people who made that transition a reality.

            Google grew at a time when the traditional role of the system administrator was being
            transformed. It questioned system administration, as if to say: we can't afford to hold
            tradition as an authority, we have to think anew, and we don't have time to wait for
            everyone else to catch up. In the introduction to <em>Principles of Network and System
            Administration</em> <a href="bibliography.html#Bur99" target=
            "_blank">[Bur99]</a>, I claimed that system administration was a form of human-computer
            engineering. This was strongly rejected by some reviewers, who said "we are not yet at
            the stage where we can call it engineering." At the time, I felt that the field had
            become lost, trapped in its own wizard culture, and could not see a way forward. Then,
            Google drew a line in the silicon, forcing that fate into being. The revised role was
            called SRE, or Site Reliability Engineer. Some of my friends were among the first of
            this new generation of engineer; they formalized it using software and automation.
            Initially, they were fiercely secretive, and what happened inside and outside of Google
            was very different: Google's experience was unique. Over time, information and methods
            have flowed in both directions. This book shows a willingness to let SRE thinking come
            out of the shadows.

            Here, we see not only how Google built its legendary infrastructure, but also how it
            studied, learned, and changed its mind about the tools and the technologies along the
            way. We, too, can face up to daunting challenges with an open spirit. The tribal nature
            of IT culture often entrenches practitioners in dogmatic positions that hold the
            industry back. If Google overcame this inertia, so can we.

            This book is a collection of essays by one company, with a single common vision. The
            fact that the contributions are aligned around a single company's goal is what makes it
            special. There are common themes, and common characters (software systems) that
            reappear in several chapters. We see choices from different perspectives, and know that
            they correlate to resolve competing interests. The articles are not rigorous, academic
            pieces; they are personal accounts, written with pride, in a variety of personal
            styles, and from the perspective of individual skill sets. They are written bravely,
            and with an intellectual honesty that is refreshing and uncommon in industry
            literature. Some claim "never do this, always do that," others are more philosophical
            and tentative, reflecting the variety of personalities within an IT culture, and how
            that too plays a role in the story. We, in turn, read them with the humility of
            observers who were not part of the journey, and do not have all the information about
            the myriad conflicting challenges. Our many questions are the real legacy of the
            volume: Why didn't they do <em>X</em>? What if they'd done <em>Y</em>? How will we look
            back on this in years to come? It is by comparing our own ideas to the reasoning here
            that we can measure our own thoughts and experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most impressive thing of all about this book is its very existence. Today, we hear
            a brazen culture of "just show me the code." A culture of "ask no questions" has grown
            up around open source, where community rather than expertise is championed. Google is a
            company that dared to think about the problems from first principles, and to employ top
            talent with a high proportion of PhDs. Tools were only components in processes, working
            alongside chains of software, people, and data. Nothing here tells us how to solve
            problems universally, but that is the point. Stories like these are far more valuable
            than the code or designs they resulted in. Implementations are ephemeral, but the
            documented reasoning is priceless. Rarely do we have access to this kind of insight.
          </p>
          <p>
            This, then, is the story of how one company did it. The fact that it is many
            overlapping stories shows us that scaling is far more than just a photographic
            enlargement of a textbook computer architecture. It is about scaling a business
            process, rather than just the machinery. This lesson alone is worth its weight in
            electronic paper.
          </p>

            We do not engage much in self-critical review in the IT world; as such, there is much
            reinvention and repetition. For many years, there was only the USENIX LISA conference
            community discussing IT infrastructure, plus a few conferences about operating systems.
            It is very different today, yet this book still feels like a rare offering: a detailed
            documentation of Google’s step through a watershed epoch. The tale is not for
            copying—though perhaps for emulating—but it can inspire the next step for all of us.
            There is a unique intellectual honesty in these pages, expressing both leadership and
            humility. These are stories of hopes, fears, successes, and failures. I salute the
            courage of authors and editors in allowing such candor, so that we, who are not party
            to the hands-on experiences, can also benefit from the lessons learned inside the
            cocoon.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="SREdeffor" data-type=
