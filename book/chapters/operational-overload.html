            Embedding an SRE to Recover from Operational Overload
          </h1>
          <p class="byline author">
            Written by Randall Bosetti<br>
            Edited by Diane Bates
          </p>
          <p>
            <a data-primary="embedded engineers" data-type="indexterm" id="embed30"></a>It's
            standard policy for Google's SRE teams to evenly split their time between projects and
            reactive ops work. In practice, this balance can be upset for months at a time by an
            increase in the daily ticket volume. A burdensome amount of ops work is especially
            dangerous because the SRE team might burn out or be unable to make progress on project
            work. When a team must allocate a disproportionate amount of time to resolving tickets
            at the cost of spending time improving the service, scalability and reliability suffer.
          </p>
          <p>
            One way to relieve this burden is to temporarily transfer an SRE into the overloaded
            team. Once embedded in a team, the SRE focuses on improving the team's practices
            instead of simply helping the team empty the ticket queue. The SRE observes the team's
            daily routine and makes recommendations to improve their practices. This consultation
            gives the team a fresh perspective on its routines that team members can't provide for
            themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you are using this approach, it isn't necessary to transfer more than one
            engineer. Two SREs don't necessarily produce better results and may actually cause
            problems if the team reacts defensively.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are starting your first SRE team, the approach outlined in this chapter will
            help you to avoid turning into an operation team solely focused on a ticket rotation.
            If you decide to embed yourself or one of your reports in a team, take time to review
            SRE practices and philosophy in <a href="introduction.html">Ben
            Treynor Sloss's introduction</a> and the material on monitoring in <a data-type="xref"
            href="monitoring-distributed-systems.html">Monitoring Distributed
            Systems</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following sections provide guidance to the SRE who will be embedded on a team.

            </h1>
            <p>
              Your job while embedded with the team is to articulate why processes and habits
              contribute to, or detract from, the service's scalability. Remind the team that more
              tickets should not require more SREs: the goal of the SRE model is to only introduce
              more humans as more complexity is added to the system. Instead, try to draw attention
              to how healthy work habits reduce the time spent on tickets. Doing so is as important
              as pointing out missed opportunities for automation or simplification of the service.

              <h5 class="subheaders">
                Ops Mode Versus Nonlinear Scaling
              </h5>
              <p>
                The term <em>ops mode</em> refers to a certain method of keeping a service running.
                Various work items increase with the size of the service. For example, a service
                needs a way to increase the number of configured virtual machines (VMs) as it
                grows. A team in ops mode responds by having a greater number of administrators
                managing those VMs. SRE instead focuses on writing software or eliminating
                scalability concerns so that the number of people required to run a service doesn't
                increase as a function of load on the service.
              </p>
            </aside>
            <p>
              Teams sliding into ops mode might be convinced that scale doesn't matter for them
              ("my service is tiny"). Shadow an on-call session to determine whether the assessment
              is true, because the element of scale affects your strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the primary service is important to the business but actually is tiny (entailing
              few resources or low complexity), put more focus on ways in which the team's current
              approach prevents them from improving the service's reliability. Remember that your
              job is to make the service work, not to shield the development team from alerts.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, if the service is just getting started, focus on ways to prepare
              the team for explosive growth. A 100 request/second service can turn into a 10k
              request/second service in a year.

              <p>
                SRE teams sometimes fall into ops mode because they focus on how to quickly address
                emergencies instead of how to reduce the number of emergencies. A default to ops
                mode usually happens in response to an overwhelming pressure, real <em>or
                imagined</em>. After you've learned enough about the service to ask hard questions
                about its design and deployment, spend some time prioritizing various service
                outages according to their impact on the team's stress levels. Keep in mind that,
                due to the team's perspective and history, some very small problems or outages may
                produce an inordinate amount of stress.

                Once you identify a team's largest existing problems, move on to emergencies
                waiting to happen. Sometimes impending emergencies come in the form of a new
                subsystem that isn't designed to be self-managing. Other sources include:

                    In large teams, people can overspecialize without immediate consequence. When a
                    person specializes, they run the risk of either not having the broad knowledge
                    they need to perform on-call support or allowing team members to ignore the
                    critical pieces of the system that they own.

              After scoping the dynamics and pain points of the team, lay the groundwork for
              improvement through best practices like postmortems and by identifying sources of
              toil and how to best address them.

                Write a Good Postmortem for the Team
              </h2>
              <p>
                Postmortems offer much insight into a team's collective reasoning. Postmortems
                conducted by unhealthy teams are often ineffectual. Some team members might
                consider postmortems punitive, or even useless. While you might be tempted to
                review the postmortem archives and leave comments for improvement, doing so doesn't
                help the team. Instead, the exercise might put the team on the defensive.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of trying to correct previous mistakes, take ownership of the next
                postmortem. There <em>will</em> be an outage while you're embedded. If you aren't
                the person on-call, team up with the on-call SRE to write a great, blameless
                postmortem. This document is an opportunity to demonstrate how a shift toward the
                SRE model benefits the team by making bug fixes more permanent. More permanent bug
                fixes reduce the impact of outages on team members' time.
              </p>
              <p>
                As mentioned, you might encounter responses such as "Why me?" This response is
                especially likely when a team believes that the postmortem process is retaliatory.
                This attitude comes from subscribing to the Bad Apple Theory: the system is working
                fine, and if we get rid of all the bad apples and their mistakes, the system will
                continue to be fine. The Bad Apple Theory is demonstrably false, as shown by
                evidence <a data-type="xref" href="bibliography.html#Dek14"
                target="_blank">[Dek14]</a> from several disciplines, including airline safety. You
                should point out this falsity. The most effective phrasing for a postmortem is to
                say, "Mistakes are inevitable in any system with multiple subtle interactions. You
                were on-call, and I trust you to make the right decisions with the right
                information. I'd like you to write down what you were thinking at each point in
                time, so that we can find out where the system misled you, and where the cognitive
                demands were too high."

                to the team and clearly explain why each fire is either work that should be
                automated or acceptable overhead for running the service.

                Teams struggling with the distinction between the SRE and traditional ops model are
                generally unable to articulate <em>why</em> certain aspects of the team's code,
                processes, or culture bother them. Rather than trying to address each of these
                issues point-by-point, work forward from the principles outlined in Chapters
                <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href=

                Your first goal for the team should be writing a service level objective (SLO), if
                one doesn't already exist. The SLO is important because it provides a quantitative
                measure of the impact of outages, in addition to how important a process change
                could be. An SLO is probably the single most important lever for moving a team from
                reactive ops work to a healthy, long-term SRE focus. If this agreement is missing,
                no other advice in this chapter will be helpful. <em>If you find yourself on a team
                without SLOs, first read <a data-type="xref" href=

                You may have a strong urge to simply fix the issues you identify. Please resist the
                urge to fix these issues yourself, because doing so bolsters the idea that "making
                changes is for other people." Instead, take the following steps:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Find useful work that can be accomplished by one team member.
                </li>
                <li>Clearly explain how this work addresses an issue from the postmortem <em>in a
                permanent way</em>. Even otherwise healthy teams can produce shortsighted action
                items.
                </li>
                <li>Serve as the reviewer for the code changes and document revisions.
                </li>
                <li>Repeat for two or three issues.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                When you identify an additional issue, put it in a bug report or a doc for the team
                to consult. Doing so serves the dual purposes of distributing information and
                encouraging team members to write docs (which are often the first victim of
                deadline pressure). Always explain your reasoning, and emphasize that good
                documentation ensures that the team doesn't repeat old mistakes in a slightly new
                context.

              <p>
                As the team recovers its momentum and grasps the basics of your suggested changes,
                move on to tackle the quotidian decisions that originally led to ops overload.
                Prepare for this undertaking to be challenged. If you're lucky, the challenge will
                be along the lines of, "Explain why. Right now. In the middle of the weekly
                production meeting."
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're unlucky, no one demands an explanation. Sidestep this problem entirely by
                simply explaining all of your decisions, whether or not someone requests an
                explanation. Refer to the basics that underscore your suggestions. Doing so helps
                build the team's mental model. <em>After you leave, the team should be able to
                predict what your comment on a design or changelist would be.</em> If you don't
                explain your reasoning, or do so poorly, there is a risk that the team will simply
                emulate that lackadaisical behavior, so be explicit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Examples of a thorough explanation of your decision:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>"I'm not pushing back on the latest release because the tests are bad. I'm
                pushing back because the error budget we set for releases is exhausted."
                </li>
                <li>"Releases need to be rollback-safe because our SLO is tight. Meeting that SLO
                requires that the mean time to recovery is small, so in-depth diagnosis before a
                rollback is not realistic."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Examples of an insufficient explanation of your decision:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>"I don't think having every server generate its routing config is safe, because
                we can't see it."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This decision is probably correct, but the reasoning is poor (or poorly explained).
                The team can't read your mind, so they very likely might emulate the observed poor
                reasoning. Instead, try "[…] isn't safe because a bug in that code can cause a
                correlated failure across the service and the additional code is a source of bugs
                that might slow down a rollback."
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>"The automation should give up if it encounters a conflicting deployment."
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Like the previous example, this explanation is probably correct, but insufficient.
                Instead, try "[…] because we're making the simplifying assumption that all changes
                pass through the automation, and something has clearly violated that rule. If this
                happens often, we should identify and remove sources of unorganized change."

                Leading questions are not loaded questions. When talking with the SRE team, try to
                ask questions in a way that encourages people to think about the basic principles.
                It's particularly valuable for <em>you</em> to model this behavior because, by
                definition, a team in ops mode rejects this sort of reasoning from its own
                constituents. Once you've spent some time explaining your reasoning for various
                policy questions, this practice reinforces the team's understanding of SRE
                philosophy.

                usually don't do anything to respond to the alert. How does this impact the SLO?"
                </li>
                <li>"This turnup procedure looks pretty complicated. Do you know why there are so
                many config files to update when creating a new instance of the service?"

            <ul>
              <li>A technical, possibly quantitative, perspective on why they should change.
              </li>
              <li>A strong example of what change looks like.
              </li>
              <li>A logical explanation for much of the "folk wisdom" used by SRE.

            <p>
              Your final task is to write an after-action report. This report should reiterate your
              perspective, examples, and explanation. It should also provide some action items for
              the team to ensure they exercise what you've taught them. You can organize the report
              as a postvitam,<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="operational-overload.html#id-p8BuzSWtjs2" id=

              The bulk of the engagement is now complete. Once your embedded assignment concludes,
              you should remain available for design and code reviews. Keep an eye on the team for
              the next few months to confirm that they're slowly improving their capacity planning,
              emergency response, and rollout processes.
