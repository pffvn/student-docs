          Managing Critical State: Distributed Consensus for Reliability

        <p>
          Processes crash or may need to be restarted. Hard drives fail. Natural disasters can take
          out several datacenters in a region. Site Reliability Engineers need to anticipate these
          sorts of failures and develop strategies to keep systems running in spite of them. These
          strategies usually entail running such systems across multiple sites. Geographically
          distributing a system is relatively straightforward, but also introduces the need to
          maintain a consistent view of system state, which is a more nuanced and difficult
          undertaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Groups of processes may want to reliably agree on questions such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Which process is the leader of a group of processes?
          </li>
          <li>What is the set of processes in a group?
          </li>
          <li>Has a message been successfully committed to a distributed queue?
          </li>
          <li>Does a process hold a lease or not?
          </li>
          <li>What is a value in a datastore for a given key?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Weâ€™ve found distributed consensus to be effective in building reliable and highly
          available systems that require a consistent view of some system state. The distributed
          consensus problem deals with reaching agreement among a group of processes connected by
          an unreliable communications network. For instance, several processes in a distributed
          system may need to be able to form a consistent view of a critical piece of
          configuration, whether or not a distributed lock is held, or if a message on a queue has
          been processed. It is one of the most fundamental concepts in distributed computing and
          one we rely on for virtually every service we offer. <a href=
          "managing-critical-state.html#fig_distributed-consensus_consensus">Figure 23-1</a> illustrates a simple model of how
          a group of processes can achieve a consistent view of system state through distributed
          consensus.
        </p>

          Whenever you see leader election, critical shared state, or distributed locking, we
          recommend using <em>distributed consensus systems that have been formally proven and
          tested thoroughly</em>. Informal approaches to solving this problem can lead to outages,
          and more insidiously, to subtle and hard-to-fix data consistency problems that may
          prolong outages in your system unnecessarily.
        </p>
        <h5 class="subheaders">
          CAP Theorem
        </h5>
        <p>
          The CAP theorem (<a href="bibliography.html#Fox99" target=
          "_blank">[Fox99]</a>, <a href="bibliography.html#Bre12" target=
          "_blank">[Bre12]</a>) holds that a distributed system cannot simultaneously have all
          three of the following properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Consistent views of the data at each node
          </li>
          <li>Availability of the data at each node
          </li>
          <li>Tolerance to network partitions <a href="bibliography.html#Gil02"
            target="_blank">[Gil02]</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The logic is intuitive: if two nodes canâ€™t communicate (because the network is
          partitioned), then the system as a whole can either stop serving some or all requests at
          some or all nodes (thus reducing availability), or it can serve requests as usual, which
          results in inconsistent views of the data at each node.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because network partitions are inevitable (cables get cut, packets get lost or delayed
          due to congestion, hardware breaks, networking components become misconfigured, etc.),
          understanding distributed consensus really amounts to understanding how consistency and
          availability work for your particular application. Commercial pressures often demand high
          levels of availability, and many applications require consistent views on their data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Systems and software engineers are usually familiar with the traditional ACID datastore
          semantics (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability), but a growing number of
          distributed datastore technologies provide a different set of semantics known as BASE
          (Basically Available, Soft state, and Eventual consistency). Datastores that support BASE
          semantics have useful applications for certain kinds of data and can handle large volumes
          of data and transactions that would be much more costly, and perhaps altogether
          infeasible, with datastores that support ACID semantics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of these systems that support BASE semantics rely on multimaster replication, where
          writes can be committed to different processes concurrently, and there is some mechanism
          to resolve conflicts (often as simple as "latest timestamp wins"). This approach is
          usually known as <em>eventual consistency</em>. However, eventual consistency can lead to
          surprising results <a href="bibliography.html#Lu15" target=
          "_blank">[Lu15]</a>, particularly in the event of <em>clock drift</em> (which is
          inevitable in distributed systems) or network partitioning <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Kin15" target="_blank">[Kin15]</a>.<sup><a href=
          "managing-critical-state.html#id-Xe4u4ioHA" id="id-Xe4u4ioHA-marker">112</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also difficult for developers to design systems that work well with datastores that
          support only BASE semantics. Jeff Shute <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Shu13" target="_blank">[Shu13]</a>, for example,
          has stated, â€œwe find developers spend a significant fraction of their time building
          extremely complex and error-prone mechanisms to cope with eventual consistency and handle
          data that may be out of date. We think this is an unacceptable burden to place on
          developers and that consistency problems should be solved at the database level."
        </p>
        <p>
          System designers cannot sacrifice correctness in order to achieve reliability or
          performance, particularly around critical state. For example, consider a system that
          handles financial transactions: reliability or performance requirements donâ€™t provide
          much value if the financial data is not correct. Systems need to be able to reliably
          synchronize critical state across multiple processes. Distributed consensus algorithms
          provide this functionality.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">
          Motivating the Use of Consensus: Distributed Systems Coordination Failure
        </h1>
        <p>
          Distributed systems are complex and subtle to understand, monitor, and troubleshoot.
          Engineers running such systems are often surprised by behavior in the presence of
          failures. Failures are relatively rare events, and it is not a usual practice to test
          systems under these conditions. It is very difficult to reason about system behavior
          during failures. Network partitions are particularly challengingâ€”a problem that appears
          to be caused by a full partition may instead be the result of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A very slow network
          </li>
          <li>Some, but not all, messages being dropped
          </li>
          <li>Throttle occurring in one direction, but not the other direction
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The following sections provide examples of problems that occurred in real-world
          distributed systems and discuss how leader election and distributed consensus algorithms
          could be used to prevent such issues.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheaders">
          Case Study 1: The Split-Brain Problem
        </h2>
        <p>
          A service is a content repository that allows collaboration between multiple users. It
          uses sets of two replicated file servers in different racks for reliability. The service
          needs to avoid writing data simultaneously to both file servers in a set, because doing
          so could result in data corruption (and possibly unrecoverable data).
        </p>
        <p>
          Each pair of file servers has one leader and one follower. The servers monitor each other
          via heartbeats. If one file server cannot contact its partner, it issues a STONITH (Shoot
          The Other Node in the Head) command to its partner node to shut the node down, and then
          takes mastership of its files. This practice is an industry standard method of reducing
          split-brain instances, although as we shall see, it is conceptually unsound.
        </p>
        <p>
          What happens if the network becomes slow, or starts dropping packets? In this scenario,
          file servers exceed their heartbeat timeouts and, as designed, send STONITH commands to
          their partner nodes and take mastership. However, some commands may not be delivered due
          to the compromised network. File server pairs may now be in a state in which both nodes
          are expected to be active for the same resource, or where both are down because both
          issued and received STONITH commands. This results in either corruption or unavailability
          of data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem here is that the system is trying to solve a leader election problem using
          simple timeouts. Leader election is a reformulation of the distributed asynchronous
          consensus problem, which cannot be solved correctly by using heartbeats.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheaders">
          Case Study 2: Failover Requires Human Intervention
        </h2>
        <p>
          A highly sharded database system has a primary for each shard, which replicates
          synchronously to a secondary in another datacenter. An external system checks the health
          of the primaries, and, if they are no longer healthy, promotes the secondary to primary.
          If the primary canâ€™t determine the health of its secondary, it makes itself unavailable
          and escalates to a human in order to avoid the split-brain scenario seen in Case Study 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          This solution doesnâ€™t risk data loss, but it does negatively impact availability of data.
          It also unnecessarily increases operational load on the engineers who run the system, and
          human intervention scales poorly. This sort of event, where a primary and secondary have
          problems communicating, is highly likely to occur in the case of a larger infrastructure
          problem, when the responding engineers may already be overloaded with other tasks. If the
          network is so badly affected that a distributed consensus system cannot elect a master, a
          human is likely not better positioned to do so.

          Case Study 3: Faulty Group-Membership Algorithms
        </h2>
        <p>
          A system has a component that performs indexing and searching services. When starting,
          nodes use a gossip protocol to discover each other and join the cluster. The cluster
          elects a leader, which performs coordination. In the case of a network partition that
          splits the cluster, each side (incorrectly) elects a master and accepts writes and
          deletions, leading to a split-brain scenario and data corruption.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem of determining a consistent view of group membership across a group of
          processes is another instance of the distributed consensus problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, many distributed systems problems turn out to be different versions of
          distributed consensus, including master election, group membership, all kinds of
          distributed locking and leasing, reliable distributed queuing and messaging, and
          maintenance of any kind of critical shared state that must be viewed consistently across
          a group of processes. All of these problems should be solved only using distributed
          consensus algorithms that have been proven formally correct, and whose implementations
          have been tested extensively. Ad hoc means of solving these sorts of problems (such as
          heartbeats and gossip protocols) will always have reliability problems in practice.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">
          How Distributed Consensus Works
        </h1>
        <p>
          The consensus problem has multiple variants. When dealing with distributed software
          systems, we are interested in <em>asynchronous distributed consensus</em>, which applies
          to environments with potentially unbounded delays in message passing. (<em>Synchronous
          consensus</em> applies to real-time systems, in which dedicated hardware means that
          messages will always be passed with specific timing guarantees.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Distributed consensus algorithms may be <em>crash-fail</em> (which assumes that crashed
          nodes never return to the system) or <em>crash-recover</em>. Crash-recover algorithms are
          much more useful, because most problems in real systems are transient in nature due to a
          slow network, restarts, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Algorithms may deal with Byzantine or non-Byzantine failures. <em>Byzantine failure</em>
          occurs when a process passes incorrect messages due to a bug or malicious activity, and
          are comparatively costly to handle, and less often encountered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technically, solving the asynchronous distributed consensus problem in bounded time is
          impossible. As proven by the Dijkstra Prizeâ€“winning <em>FLP impossibility result</em>
          <a href="bibliography.html#Fis85" target="_blank">[Fis85]</a>, no
          asynchronous distributed consensus algorithm can guarantee progress in the presence of an
          unreliable network.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, we approach the distributed consensus problem in bounded time by ensuring
          that the system will have sufficient healthy replicas and network connectivity to make
          progress reliably most of the time. In addition, the system should have backoffs with
          randomized delays. This setup both prevents retries from causing cascade effects and
          avoids the dueling proposers problem described later in this chapter. The protocols
          guarantee safety, and adequate redundancy in the system encourages liveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The original solution to the distributed consensus problem was Lamportâ€™s Paxos protocol
          <a href="bibliography.html#Lam98" target="_blank">[Lam98]</a>, but
          other protocols exist that solve the problem, including Raft <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Ong14" target="_blank">[Ong14]</a>, Zab <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Jun11" target="_blank">[Jun11]</a>, and Mencius
          <a href="bibliography.html#Mao08" target="_blank">[Mao08]</a>. Paxos
          itself has many variations intended to increase performance <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Zoo14" target="_blank">[Zoo14]</a>. These usually
          vary only in a single detail, such as giving a special leader role to one process to
          streamline the protocol.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheaders">
          Paxos Overview: An Example Protocol
        </h2>
        <p>
          Paxos operates as a sequence of proposals, which may or may not be accepted by a majority
          of the processes in the system. If a proposal isnâ€™t accepted, it fails. Each proposal has
          a sequence number, which imposes a strict ordering on all of the operations in the
          system.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first phase of the protocol, the proposer sends a sequence number to the
          acceptors. Each acceptor will agree to accept the proposal only if it has not yet seen a
          proposal with a higher sequence number. Proposers can try again with a higher sequence
          number if necessary. Proposers must use unique sequence numbers (drawing from disjoint
          sets, or incorporating their hostname into the sequence number, for instance).
        </p>
        <p>
          If a proposer receives agreement from a majority of the acceptors, it can commit the
          proposal by sending a commit message with a value.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strict sequencing of proposals solves any problems relating to ordering of messages
          in the system. The requirement for a majority to commit means that two different values
          cannot be committed for the same proposal, because any two majorities will overlap in at
          least one node. Acceptors must write a journal on persistent storage whenever they agree
          to accept a proposal, because the acceptors need to honor these guarantees after
          restarting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paxos on its own isnâ€™t that useful: all it lets you do is to agree on a value and
          proposal number once. Because only a quorum of nodes need to agree on a value, any given
          node may not have a complete view of the set of values that have been agreed to. This
          limitation is true for most distributed consensus algorithms.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">
          System Architecture Patterns for Distributed Consensus
        </h1>
        <p>
          Distributed consensus algorithms are low-level and primitive: they simply allow a set of
          nodes to agree on a value, once. They donâ€™t map well to real design tasks. What makes
          distributed consensus useful is the addition of higher-level system components such as
          datastores, configuration stores, queues, locking, and leader election services to
          provide the practical system functionality that distributed consensus algorithms donâ€™t
          address. Using higher-level components reduces complexity for system designers. It also
          allows underlying distributed consensus algorithms to be changed if necessary in response
          to changes in the environment in which the system runs or changes in nonfunctional
          requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many systems that successfully use consensus algorithms actually do so as clients of some
          service that implements those algorithms, such as Zookeeper, Consul, and etcd. Zookeeper
          <a href="bibliography.html#Hun10" target="_blank">[Hun10]</a> was the
          first open source consensus system to gain traction in the industry because it was easy
          to use, even with applications that werenâ€™t designed to use distributed consensus. The
          Chubby service fills a similar niche at Google. Its authors point out <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Bur06" target="_blank">[Bur06]</a> that providing
          consensus primitives as a service rather than as libraries that engineers build into
          their applications frees application maintainers of having to deploy their systems in a
          way compatible with a highly available consensus service (running the right number of
          replicas, dealing with group membership, dealing with performance, etc.).
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheaders">
          Reliable Replicated State Machines
        </h2>
        <p>
          A <em>replicated state machine</em> (RSM) is a system that executes the same set of
          operations, in the same order, on several processes. RSMs are the fundamental building
          block of useful distributed systems components and services such as data or configuration
          storage, locking, and leader election (described in more detail later).
        </p>
        <p>
          The operations on an RSM are ordered globally through a consensus algorithm. This is a
          powerful concept: several papers (<a href="bibliography.html#Agu10"
          target="_blank">[Agu10]</a>, <a href="bibliography.html#Kir08" target=
          "_blank">[Kir08]</a>, <a href="bibliography.html#Sch90" target=
          "_blank">[Sch90]</a>) show that any deterministic program can be implemented as a highly
          available replicated service by being implemented as an RSM.
        </p>
        <p>
          As shown in <a href="managing-critical-state.html#fig_distributed-consensus_consensus-rsm-relationship">Figure
          23-2</a>, replicated state machines are a system implemented at a logical layer above the
          consensus algorithm. The consensus algorithm deals with agreement on the sequence of
          operations, and the RSM executes the operations in that order. Because not every member
          of the consensus group is necessarily a member of each consensus quorum, RSMs may need to
          synchronize state from peers. As described by Kirsch and Amir <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Kir08" target="_blank">[Kir08]</a>, you can use a
          <em>sliding-window protocol</em> to reconcile state between peer processes in an RSM.

          Reliable Replicated Datastores and Configuration Stores
        </h2>
        <p>
          Reliable replicated datastores are an application of replicated state machines.
          Replicated datastores use consensus algorithms in the critical path of their work. Thus,
          performance, throughput, and the ability to scale are very important in this type of
          design. As with datastores built with other underlying technologies, consensus-based
          datastores can provide a variety of consistency semantics for read operations, which make
          a huge difference to how the datastore scales. These trade-offs are discussed in <a href=
          "managing-critical-state.html#xref_distributed-consensus_performance">Distributed Consensus Performance</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other (nondistributed-consensusâ€“<wbr>based) systems often simply rely on timestamps to
          provide bounds on the age of data being returned. Timestamps are highly problematic in
          distributed systems because itâ€™s impossible to guarantee that clocks are synchronized
          across multiple machines. Spanner <a href="bibliography.html#Cor12"
          target="_blank">[Cor12]</a> addresses this problem by modeling the worst-case uncertainty
          involved and slowing down processing where necessary to resolve that uncertainty.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheaders">
          Highly Available Processing Using Leader Election
        </h2>
        <p>
          Leader election in distributed systems is an equivalent problem to distributed consensus.
          Replicated services that use a single leader to perform some specific type of work in the
          system are very common; the single leader mechanism is a way of ensuring mutual exclusion
          at a coarse level.
        </p>
        <p>
          This type of design is appropriate where the work of the service leader can be performed
          by one process or is sharded. System designers can construct a highly available service
          by writing it as though it was a simple program, replicating that process and using
          leader election to ensure that only one leader is working at any point in time (as shown
          in <a href="managing-critical-state.html#fig_distributed-consensus_ha-with-rsm">Figure 23-3</a>). Often the work of
          the leader is that of coordinating some pool of workers in the system. This pattern was
          used in GFS <a href="bibliography.html#Ghe03" target=
          "_blank">[Ghe03]</a> (which has been replaced by Colossus) and the Bigtable key-value
          store <a href="bibliography.html#Cha06" target="_blank">[Cha06]</a>.

        <p>
          In this type of component, unlike the replicated datastore, the consensus algorithm is
          not in the critical path of the main work the system is doing, so throughput is usually
          not a major concern.

          Distributed Coordination and Locking Services
        </h2>
        <p>
          A <em>barrier</em> in a distributed computation is a primitive that blocks a group of
          processes from proceeding until some condition is met (for example, until all parts of
          one phase of a computation are completed). Use of a barrier effectively splits a
          distributed computation into logical phases. For instance, as shown in <a href=
          "managing-critical-state.html#fig_distributed-consensus_mapreduce-barriers">Figure 23-4</a>, a barrier could be used
          in implementing the MapReduce <a href="bibliography.html#Dea04"
          target="_blank">[Dea04]</a> model to ensure that the entire Map phase is completed before
          the Reduce part of the computation proceeds.

        <p>
          The barrier could be implemented by a single coordinator process, but this implementation
          adds a single point of failure that is usually unacceptable. The barrier can also be
          implemented as an RSM. The Zookeeper consensus service can implement the barrier pattern:
          see <a href="bibliography.html#Hun10" target="_blank">[Hun10]</a> and
          <a href="bibliography.html#Zoo14" target="_blank">[Zoo14]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Locks</em> are another useful coordination primitive that can be implemented as an
          RSM. Consider a distributed system in which worker processes atomically consume some
          input files and write results. Distributed locks can be used to prevent multiple workers
          from processing the same input file. In practice, it is essential to use renewable leases
          with timeouts instead of indefinite locks, because doing so prevents locks from being
          held indefinitely by processes that crash. Distributed locking is beyond the scope of
          this chapter, but bear in mind that distributed locks are a low-level systems primitive
          that should be used with care. Most applications should use a higher-level system that
          provides distributed transactions.

          Reliable Distributed Queuing and Messaging
        </h2>
        <p>
          Queues are a common data structure, often used as a way to distribute tasks between a
          number of worker processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Queuing-based systems can tolerate failure and loss of worker nodes relatively easily.
          However, the system must ensure that claimed tasks are successfully processed. For that
          purpose, a <em>lease system</em> (discussed earlier in regard to locks) is recommended
          instead of an outright removal from the queue. The downside of queuing-based systems is
          that loss of the queue prevents the entire system from operating. Implementing the queue
          as an RSM can minimize the risk, and make the entire system far more robust.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Atomic broadcast</em> is a distributed systems primitive in which messages are
          received reliably and in the same order by all participants. This is an incredibly
          powerful distributed systems concept and very useful in designing practical systems. A
          huge number of publish-subscribe messaging infrastructures exist for the use of system
          designers, although not all of them provide atomic guarantees. Chandra and Toueg <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Cha96" target="_blank">[Cha96]</a> demonstrate the
          equivalence of atomic broadcast and consensus.

          The <em>queuing-as-work-distribution</em> pattern, which uses the queue as a load
          balancing device, as shown in <a href="managing-critical-state.html#fig_distributed-consensus_queuing">Figure
          23-5</a>, can be considered to be point-to-point messaging. Messaging systems usually
          also implement a publish-subscribe queue, where messages may be consumed by many clients
          that subscribe to a channel or topic. In this one-to-many case, the messages on the queue
          are stored as a persistent ordered list. Publish-subscribe systems can be used for many
          types of applications that require clients to subscribe to receive notifications of some
          type of event. Publish-subscribe systems can also be used to implement coherent
          distributed caches.

          Distributed Consensus Performance

        <p>
          Conventional wisdom has generally held that consensus algorithms are too slow and costly
          to use for many systems that require high throughput <em>and</em> low latency <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Bol11" target="_blank">[Bol11]</a>. This conception
          is simply not trueâ€”while implementations can be slow, there are a number of tricks that
          can improve performance. Distributed consensus algorithms are at the core of many of
          Googleâ€™s critical systems, described in <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Ana13" target="_blank">[Ana13]</a>, <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Bur06" target="_blank">[Bur06]</a>, <a href=

          proven extremely effective in practice. Googleâ€™s scale is not an advantage here: in fact,
          our scale is more of a disadvantage because it introduces two main challenges: our
          datasets tend to be large and our systems run over a wide geographical distance. Larger
          datasets multiplied by several replicas represent significant computing costs, and larger
          geographical distances increase latency between replicas, which in turn reduces
          performance.

        <p>
          There is no one "best" distributed consensus and state machine replication algorithm for
          performance, because performance is dependent on a number of factors relating to
          workload, the systemâ€™s performance objectives, and how the system is to be
          deployed.<sup><a href="managing-critical-state.html#id-jE2uxSEIwhM" id="id-jE2uxSEIwhM-marker">113</a></sup> While
          some of the following sections present research, with the aim of increasing understanding

          <em>Workloads</em> can vary in many ways and understanding how they can vary is critical
          to discussing performance. In the case of a consensus system, workload may vary in terms
          of:

        <ul>
          <li>Throughput: the number of proposals being made per unit of time at peak load

          Many consensus systems use a distinguished leader process and require all requests to go
          to this special node. As shown in <a href=
          "managing-critical-state.html#fig_distributed-consensus_distance-latency">Figure 23-6</a>, as a result, the
          performance of the system as perceived by clients in different geographic locations may
          vary considerably, simply because more distant nodes have longer round-trip times to the
          leader process.

          Multi-Paxos: Detailed Message Flow
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Multi-Paxos protocol uses a <em>strong leader process</em>: unless a leader has not
          yet been elected or some failure occurs, it requires only one round trip from the
          proposer to a quorum of acceptors to reach consensus. Using a strong leader process is
          optimal in terms of the number of messages to be passed, and is typical of many consensus
          <span>protocols</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="managing-critical-state.html#fig_distributed-consensus_multipaxos-basic">Figure 23-7</a> shows an initial
          state with a new proposer executing the first <code>Prepare</code>/<code>Promise</code>
          phase of the protocol. Executing this phase establishes a new numbered view, or leader
          term. On subsequent executions of the protocol, while the view remains the same, the
          first phase is unnecessary because the proposer that established the view can simply send
          <code>Accept</code> messages, and consensus is reached once a quorum of responses is
          received (including the proposer itself).

          Another process in the group can assume the proposer role to propose messages at any
          time, but changing the proposer has a performance cost. It necessitates the extra round
          trip to execute Phase 1 of the protocol, but more importantly, it may cause a <em>dueling
          proposers</em> situation in which proposals repeatedly interrupt each other and no
          proposals can be accepted, as shown in <a href=
          "managing-critical-state.html#fig_distributed-consensus_multipaxos-livelock">Figure 23-8</a>. Because this scenario
          is a form of a livelock, it can continue indefinitely.

        <p>
          All practical consensus systems address this issue of collisions, usually either by
          electing a proposer process, which makes all proposals in the system, or by using a
          rotating proposer that allocates each process particular slots for their proposals.
        </p>
        <p>
          For systems that use a leader process, the leader election process must be tuned
          carefully to balance the system unavailability that occurs when no leader is present with
          the risk of dueling proposers. Itâ€™s important to implement the right timeouts and backoff
          strategies. If multiple processes detect that there is no leader and all attempt to
          become leader at the same time, then none of the processes is likely to succeed (again,
          dueling proposers). Introducing randomness is the best approach. Raft <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Ong14" target="_blank">[Ong14]</a>, for example,
          has a well-thought-out method of approaching the leader election process.

          Scaling Read-Heavy Workloads
        </h2>
        <p>
          Scaling read workload is often critical because many workloads are read-heavy. Replicated
          datastores have the advantage that the data is available in multiple places, meaning that
          if strong consistency is not required for all reads, data could be read from <em>any</em>
          replica. This technique of reading from replicas works well for certain applications,
          such as Googleâ€™s Photon system <a href="bibliography.html#Ana13"
          target="_blank">[Ana13]</a>, which uses distributed consensus to coordinate the work of
          multiple pipelines. Photon uses an atomic compare-and-set operation for state
          modification (inspired by atomic registers), which must be absolutely consistent; but
          read operations may be served from any replica, because stale data results in extra work
          being performed but not incorrect results <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Gup15" target="_blank">[Gup15]</a>. The trade-off
          is worthwhile.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to guarantee that data being read is up-to-date and consistent with any changes
          made before the read is performed, it is necessary to do one of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Perform a read-only consensus operation.
          </li>
          <li>Read the data from a replica that is guaranteed to be the most up-to-date. In a
          system that uses a stable leader process (as many distributed consensus implementations
          do), the leader can provide this guarantee.
          </li>
          <li>Use quorum leases, in which some replicas are granted a lease on all or part of the
          data in the system, allowing strongly consistent local reads at the cost of some write
          performance. This technique is discussed in detail in the following section.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="subheaders">
          Quorum Leases
        </h2>
        <p>
          Quorum leases <a href="bibliography.html#Mor14" target=
          "_blank">[Mor14]</a> are a recently developed distributed consensus performance
          optimization aimed at reducing latency and increasing throughput for read operations. As
          previously mentioned, in the case of classic Paxos and most other distributed consensus
          protocols, performing a strongly consistent read (i.e., one that is guaranteed to have
          the most up-to-date view of state) requires either a distributed consensus operation that
          reads from a quorum of replicas, or a stable leader replica that is guaranteed to have
          seen all recent state changing operations. In many systems, read operations vastly
          outnumber writes, so this reliance on either a distributed operation or a single replica
          harms latency and system throughput.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quorum leasing technique simply grants a read lease on some subset of the replicated
          datastoreâ€™s state to a quorum of replicas. The lease is for a specific (usually brief)
          period of time. Any operation that changes the state of that data must be acknowledged by
          all replicas in the read quorum. If any of these replicas becomes unavailable, the data
          cannot be modified until the lease expires.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quorum leases are particularly useful for read-heavy workloads in which reads for
          particular subsets of the data are concentrated in a single geographic region.

        <h2 class="subheaders">
          Distributed Consensus Performance and Network Latency
        </h2>
        <p>
          Consensus systems face two major physical constraints on performance when committing
          state changes. One is network round-trip time and the other is time it takes to write
          data to persistent storage, which will be examined later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Network round-trip times vary enormously depending on source and destination location,
          which are impacted both by the physical distance between the source and the destination,
          and by the amount of congestion on the network. Within a single datacenter, round-trip
          times between machines should be on the order of a millisecond. A typical round-trip-time
          (RTT) within the United States is 45 milliseconds, and from New York to London is 70
          milliseconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consensus system performance over a local area network can be comparable to that of an
          asynchronous leader-follower replication system <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Bol11" target="_blank">[Bol11]</a>, such as many
          traditional databases use for replication. However, much of the availability benefits of
          distributed consensus systems require replicas to be "distant" from each other, in order
          to be in different failure domains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many consensus systems use TCP/IP as their communication protocol. TCP/IP is
          connection-oriented and provides some strong reliability guarantees regarding FIFO
          sequencing of messages. However, setting up a new TCP/IP connection requires a network
          round trip to perform the three-way handshake that sets up a connection before any data
          can be sent or received. TCP/IP slow start initially limits the bandwidth of the
          connection until its limits have been established. Initial TCP/IP window sizes range from
          4 to 15 KB.
        </p>
        <p>
          TCP/IP slow start is probably not an issue for the processes that form a consensus group:
          they will establish connections to each other and keep these connections open for reuse
          because theyâ€™ll be in frequent communication. However, for systems with a very high
          number of clients, it may not be practical for all clients to keep a persistent
          connection to the consensus clusters open, because open TCP/IP connections do consume
          some resources, e.g., file descriptors, in addition to generating keepalive traffic. This
          overhead may be an important issue for applications that use very highly sharded
          consensus-based datastores containing thousands of replicas and an even larger numbers of
          clients. A solution is to use a pool of regional proxies, as shown in <a href=
          "managing-critical-state.html#fig_distributed-consensus_proxies">Figure 23-9</a>, which hold persistent TCP/IP
          connections to the consensus group in order to avoid the setup overhead over long
          distances. Proxies may also be a good way to encapsulate sharding and load balancing
          strategies, as well as discovery of cluster members and leaders.

          Reasoning About Performance: Fast Paxos
        </h2>
        <p>
          Fast Paxos <a href="bibliography.html#Lam06" target=
          "_blank">[Lam06]</a> is a version of the Paxos algorithm designed to improve its
          performance over wide area networks. Using Fast Paxos, each client can send
          <code>Propose</code> messages directly to each member of a group of acceptors, instead of
          through a leader, as in Classic Paxos or Multi-Paxos. The idea is to substitute one
          parallel message send from the client to all acceptors in Fast Paxos for two message send
          operations in Classic Paxos:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>One message from the client to a single proposer
          </li>
          <li>A parallel message send operation from the proposer to the other replicas
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Intuitively, it seems as though Fast Paxos should always be faster than Classic Paxos.
          However, thatâ€™s not true: if the client in the Fast Paxos system has a high RTT
          (round-trip time) to the acceptors, and the acceptors have fast connections to each
          other, we have substituted <em>N</em> parallel messages across the slower network links
          (in Fast Paxos) for one message across the slower link plus <em>N</em> parallel messages
          across the faster links (Classic Paxos). Due to the latency tail effect, the majority of
          the time, a single round trip across a slow link with a distribution of latencies is
          faster than a quorum (as shown in <a href="bibliography.html#Jun07"
          target="_blank">[Jun07]</a>), and therefore, Fast Paxos is slower than Classic Paxos in
          this case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many systems batch multiple operations into a single transaction at the acceptor to
          increase throughput. Having clients act as proposers also makes it much more difficult to
          batch proposals. The reason for this is that proposals arrive independently at acceptors
          so you canâ€™t then batch them in a consistent way.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheaders">
          Stable Leaders
        </h2>
        <p>
          We have seen how Multi-Paxos elects a stable leader to improve performance. Zab <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Jun11" target="_blank">[Jun11]</a> and Raft
          <a href="bibliography.html#Ong14" target="_blank">[Ong14]</a> are also
          examples of protocols that elect a stable leader for performance reasons. This approach
          can allow read optimizations, as the leader has the most up-to-date state, but also has
          several problems:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All operations that change state must be sent via the leader, a requirement that adds
          network latency for clients that are not located near the leader.
          </li>
          <li>The leader processâ€™s outgoing network bandwidth is a system bottleneck <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Mao08" target="_blank">[Mao08]</a>, because the
          leaderâ€™s <code>Accept</code> message contains all of the data related to any proposal,
          whereas other messages contain only acknowledgments of a numbered transaction with no
          data payload.
          </li>
          <li>If the leader happens to be on a machine with performance problems, then the
          throughput of the entire system will be reduced.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Almost all distributed consensus systems that have been designed with performance in mind
          use either the single stable leader pattern or a system of rotating leadership in which
          each numbered distributed consensus algorithm is preassigned to a replica (usually by a
          simple modulus of the transaction ID). Algorithms that use this approach include Mencius
          <a href="bibliography.html#Mao08" target="_blank">[Mao08]</a> and
          Egalitarian Paxos <a href="bibliography.html#Mor12a" target=
          "_blank">[Mor12a]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over a wide area network with clients spread out geographically and replicas from the
          consensus group located reasonably near to the clients, such leader election leads to
          lower perceived latency for clients because their network RTT to the nearest replica
          will, on average, be smaller than that to an arbitrary leader.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheaders">
          Batching
        </h2>
        <p>
          Batching, as described in <a href="managing-critical-state.html#xref_distributed-consensus_fast-paxos">Reasoning
          About Performance: Fast Paxos</a>, increases system throughput, but it still leaves
          replicas idle while they await replies to messages they have sent. The inefficiencies
          presented by idle replicas can be solved by <em>pipelining</em>, which allows multiple
          proposals to be in-flight at once. This optimization is very similar to the TCP/IP case,
          in which the protocol attempts to "keep the pipe full" using a sliding-window approach.
          Pipelining is normally used in combination with batching.
        </p>
        <p>
          The batches of requests in the pipeline are still globally ordered with a view number and
          a transaction number, so this method does not violate the global ordering properties
          required to run a replicated state machine. This optimization method is discussed in
          <a href="bibliography.html#Bol11" target="_blank">[Bol11]</a> and

          Disk Access
        </h2>
        <p>
          Logging to persistent storage is required so that a node, having crashed and returned to
          the cluster, honors whatever previous commitments it made regarding ongoing consensus
          transactions. In the Paxos protocol, for instance, acceptors cannot agree to a proposal
          when they have already agreed to a proposal with a higher sequence number. If details of
          agreed and committed proposals are not logged to persistent storage, then an acceptor
          might violate the protocol if it crashes and is restarted, leading to inconsistent state.
        </p>
        <p>
          The time required to write an entry to a log on disk varies greatly depending on what
          hardware or virtualized environment is used, but is likely to take between one and
          several milliseconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The message flow for Multi-Paxos was discussed in <a href=
          "managing-critical-state.html#xref_distributed-consensus_multi-paxos">Multi-Paxos: Detailed Message Flow</a>, but
          this section did not show where the protocol must log state changes to disk. A disk write
          must happen whenever a process makes a commitment that it must honor. In the
          performance-critical second phase of Multi-Paxos, these points occur before an acceptor
          sends an <code>Accepted</code> message in response to a proposal, and before the proposer
          sends the <code>Accept</code> message, because this <code>Accept</code> message is also
          an implicit <code>Accepted</code> message <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Lam98" target="_blank">[Lam98]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that the latency for a single consensus operation involves the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>One disk write on the proposer
          </li>
          <li>Parallel messages to the acceptors
          </li>
          <li>Parallel disk writes at the acceptors
          </li>
          <li>The return messages
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There is a version of the Multi-Paxos protocol thatâ€™s useful for cases in which disk
          write time dominates: this variant doesnâ€™t consider the proposerâ€™s <code>Accept</code>
          message to be an implicit <code>Accepted</code> message. Instead, the proposer writes to
          disk in parallel with the other processes and sends an explicit <code>Accept</code>
          message. Latency then becomes proportional to the time taken to send two messages and for
          a quorum of processes to execute a synchronous write to disk in parallel.
        </p>
        <p>
          If latency for performing a small random write to disk is on the order of 10
          milliseconds, the rate of consensus operations will be limited to approximately 100 per
          second. These times assume that network round-trip times are negligible and the proposer
          performs its logging in parallel with the acceptors.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we have seen already, distributed consensus algorithms are often used as the basis for
          building a replicated state machine. RSMs also need to keep transaction logs for recovery
          purposes (for the same reasons as any datastore). The consensus algorithmâ€™s log and the
          RSMâ€™s transaction log can be combined into a single log. Combining these logs avoids the
          need to constantly alternate between writing to two different physical locations on disk
          <a href="bibliography.html#Bol11" target="_blank">[Bol11]</a>,
          reducing the time spent on seek operations. The disks can sustain more operations per
          second and therefore, the system as a whole can perform more transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a datastore, disks have purposes other than maintaining logs: system state is
          generally maintained on disk. Log writes must be flushed directly to disk, but writes for
          state changes can be written to a memory cache and flushed to disk later, reordered to
          use the most efficient schedule <a href="bibliography.html#Bol11"
          target="_blank">[Bol11]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another possible optimization is batching multiple client operations together into one

          Deploying Distributed Consensus-Based Systems
        </h1>
        <p>
          The most critical decisions system designers must make when deploying a consensus-based
          system concern the number of replicas to be deployed and the location of those replicas.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheaders">
          Number of Replicas
        </h2>
        <p>
          In general, consensus-based systems operate using <em>majority quorums</em>, i.e., a
          group of <span>2f + 1</span> replicas may tolerate <span>f</span> failures (if Byzantine
          fault tolerance, in which the system is resistant to replicas returning incorrect
          results, is required, then <span>3f + 1</span> replicas may tolerate <span>f</span>
          failures <a href="bibliography.html#Cas99" target=
          "_blank">[Cas99]</a>). For non-Byzantine failures, the minimum number of replicas that
          can be deployed is threeâ€”if two are deployed, then there is no tolerance for failure of
          any process. Three replicas may tolerate one failure. Most system downtime is a result of
          planned maintenance <a href="bibliography.html#Ken12" target=
          "_blank">[Ken12]</a>: three replicas allow a system to operate normally when one replica
          is down for maintenance (assuming that the remaining two replicas can handle system load
          at an acceptable performance).
        </p>
        <p>
          If an unplanned failure occurs during a maintenance window, then the consensus system
          becomes unavailable. Unavailability of the consensus system is usually unacceptable, and
          so five replicas should be run, allowing the system to operate with up to two failures.
          No intervention is necessarily required if four out of five replicas in a consensus
          system remain, but if three are left, an additional replica or two should be added.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a consensus system loses so many of its replicas that it cannot form a quorum, then
          that system is, in theory, in an unrecoverable state because the durable logs of at least
          one of the missing replicas cannot be accessed. If no quorum remains, itâ€™s possible that
          a decision that was seen only by the missing replicas was made. Administrators may be
          able to force a change in the group membership and add new replicas that catch up from
          the existing one in order to proceed, but the possibility of data loss always remainsâ€”a
          situation that should be avoided if at all possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a disaster, administrators have to decide whether to perform such a forceful
          reconfiguration or to wait for some period of time for machines with system state to
          become available. When such decisions are being made, treatment of the systemâ€™s log (in
          addition to monitoring) becomes critical. Theoretical papers often point out that
          consensus can be used to construct a replicated log, but fail to discuss how to deal with
          replicas that may fail and recover (and thus miss some sequence of consensus decisions)
          or lag due to slowness. In order to maintain robustness of the system, it is important
          that these replicas do catch up.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>replicated log</em> is not always a first-class citizen in distributed consensus
          theory, but it is a very important aspect of production systems. Raft describes a method
          for managing the consistency of replicated logs <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Ong14" target="_blank">[Ong14]</a> explicitly
          defining how any gaps in a replicaâ€™s log are filled. If a five-instance Raft system loses
          all of its members except for its leader, the leader is still guaranteed to have full
          knowledge of all committed decisions. On the other hand, if the missing majority of
          members included the leader, no strong guarantees can be made regarding how up-to-date
          the remaining replicas are.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a relationship between performance and the number of replicas in a system that
          do not need to form part of a quorum: a minority of slower replicas may lag behind,
          allowing the quorum of better-performing replicas to run faster (as long as the leader
          performs well). If replica performance varies significantly, then every failure may
          reduce the performance of the system overall because slow outliers will be required to
          form a quorum. The more failures or lagging replicas a system can tolerate, the better
          the systemâ€™s performance overall is likely to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The issue of cost should also be considered in managing replicas: each replica uses
          costly computing resources. If the system in question is a single cluster of processes,
          the cost of running replicas is probably not a large consideration. However, the cost of
          replicas can be a serious consideration for systems such as Photon <a href=
          "bibliography.html#Ana13" target="_blank">[Ana13]</a>, which uses a
          sharded configuration in which each shard is a full group of processes running a
          consensus algorithm. As the number of shards grows, so does the cost of each additional
          replica, because a number of processes equal to the number of shards must be added to the
          system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decision about the number of replicas for any system is thus a trade-off between the
          following factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The need for reliability
          </li>
          <li>Frequency of planned maintenance affecting the system
          </li>
          <li>Risk
          </li>
          <li>Performance
          </li>
          <li>Cost
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This calculation will be different for each system: systems have different service level
          objectives for availability; some organizations perform maintenance more regularly than
          others; and organizations use hardware of varying cost, quality, and reliability.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheaders">
          Location of Replicas
        </h2>
        <p>
          Decisions about where to deploy the processes that comprise a consensus cluster are made
          based upon two factors: a trade-off between the failure domains that the system should
          handle, and the latency requirements for the system. Multiple complex issues are at play
          in deciding where to locate replicas.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>failure domain</em> is the set of components of a system that can become
          unavailable as a result of a single failure. Example failure domains include the
          following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A physical machine
          </li>
          <li>A rack in a datacenter served by a single power supply
          </li>
          <li>Several racks in a datacenter that are served by one piece of networking
          <span>equipment</span>
          </li>
          <li>A datacenter that could be rendered unavailable by a fiber optic cable cut
          </li>
          <li>A set of datacenters in a single geographic area that could all be affected by a
          single natural disaster such as a hurricane
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In general, as the distance between replicas increases, so does the round-trip time
          between replicas, as well as the size of the failure the system will be able to tolerate.
          For most consensus systems, increasing the round-trip time between replicas will also
          increase the latency of operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The extent to which latency matters, as well as the ability to survive a failure in a
          particular domain, is very system-dependent. Some consensus system architectures donâ€™t
          require particularly high throughput or low latency: for example, a consensus system that
          exists in order to provide group membership and leader election services for a highly
          available service probably isnâ€™t heavily loaded, and if the consensus transaction time is
          only a fraction of the leader lease time, then its performance isnâ€™t critical.
          Batch-oriented systems are also less affected by latency: operation batch sizes can be
          increased to increase throughput.
        </p>
        <p>
          It doesnâ€™t always make sense to continually increase the size of the failure domain whose
          loss the system can withstand. For instance, if all of the clients using a consensus
          system are running within a particular failure domain (say, the New York area) and
          deploying a distributed consensusâ€“based system across a wider geographical area would
          allow it to remain serving during outages in that failure domain (say, Hurricane Sandy),
          is it worth it? Probably not, because the systemâ€™s clients will be down as well so the
          system will see no traffic. The extra cost in terms of latency, throughput, and computing
          resources would give no benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should take disaster recovery into account when deciding where to locate your
          replicas: in a system that stores critical data, the consensus replicas are also
          essentially online copies of the system data. However, when critical data is at stake,
          itâ€™s important to back up regular snapshots elsewhere, even in the case of solid
          consensusâ€“based systems that are deployed in several diverse failure domains. There are
          two failure domains that you can never escape: the software itself, and human error on
          the part of the systemâ€™s administrators. Bugs in software can emerge under unusual
          circumstances and cause data loss, while system misconfiguration can have similar
          effects. Human operators can also err, or perform sabotage causing data loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          When making decisions about location of replicas, remember that the most important
          measure of performance is client perception: ideally, the network round-trip time from
          the clients to the consensus systemâ€™s replicas should be minimized. Over a wide area
          network, leaderless protocols like Mencius or Egalitarian Paxos may have a performance
          edge, particularly if the consistency constraints of the application mean that it is
          possible to execute read-only operations on any system replica without performing a
          consensus operation.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheaders">
          Capacity and Load Balancing
        </h2>
        <p>
          When designing a deployment, you must make sure there is sufficient capacity to deal with
          load. In the case of <em>sharded deployments</em>, you can adjust capacity by adjusting
          the number of shards. However, for systems that can read from consensus group members
          that are not the leader, you can increase read capacity by adding more replicas. Adding
          more replicas has a cost: in an algorithm that uses a strong leader, adding replicas
          imposes more load on the leader process, while in a peer-to-peer protocol, adding
          replicas imposes more load on all processes. However, if there is ample capacity for
          write operations, but a read-heavy workload is stressing the system, adding replicas may
          be the best approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted that adding a replica in a majority quorum system can potentially
          decrease system availability somewhat (as shown in <a href=
          "managing-critical-state.html#fig_distributed-consensus_region-diversity">Figure 23-10</a>). A typical deployment for
          Zookeeper or Chubby uses five replicas, so a majority quorum requires three replicas. The
          system will still make progress if two replicas, or 40%, are unavailable. With six
          replicas, a quorum requires four replicas: only 33% of the replicas can be unavailable if
          the system is to remain live.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considerations regarding failure domains therefore apply even more strongly when a sixth
          replica is added: if an organization has five datacenters, and generally runs consensus
          groups with five processes, one in each datacenter, then loss of one datacenter still
          leaves one spare replica in each group. If a sixth replica is deployed in one of the five
          datacenters, then an outage in that datacenter removes both of the spare replicas in the
          group, thereby reducing capacity by 33%.

          "Adding an extra replica in one region may reduce system availability. Colocating multiple replicas in a single datacenter may reduce system availability: here there is a quorum without any redundancy remaining."

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          If clients are dense in a particular geographic region, it is best to locate replicas
          close to clients. However, deciding where exactly to locate replicas may require some
          careful thought around load balancing and how a system deals with overload. As shown in
          <a href="managing-critical-state.html#fig_distributed-consensus_sharded-leaders">Figure 23-11</a>, if a system simply
          routes client read requests to the nearest replica, then a large spike in load
          concentrated in one region may overwhelm the nearest replica, and then the next-closest
          replica, and so onâ€”this is <em>cascading failure</em> (see <a href=
          "addressing-cascading-failures.html">Addressing Cascading
          Failures</a>). This type of overload can often happen as a result of batch jobs
          beginning, especially if several begin at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Weâ€™ve already seen the reason that many distributed consensus systems use a leader
          process to improve performance. However, itâ€™s important to understand that the leader
          replicas will use more computational resources, particularly outgoing network capacity.
          This is because the leader sends proposal messages that include the proposed data, but
          replicas send smaller messages, usually just containing agreement with a particular
          consensus transaction ID. Organizations that run highly sharded consensus systems with a
          very large number of processes may find it necessary to ensure that leader processes for
          the different shards are balanced relatively evenly across different datacenters. Doing
          so prevents the system as a whole from being bottlenecked on outgoing network capacity
          for just one datacenter, and makes for much greater overall system capacity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another downside of deploying consensus groups in multiple datacenters (shown by <a href=
          "managing-critical-state.html#fig_distributed-consensus_sharded-leaders">Figure 23-11</a>) is the very extreme change
          in the system that can occur if the datacenter hosting the leaders suffers a widespread
          failure (power, networking equipment failure, or fiber cut, for instance). As shown in
          <a href="managing-critical-state.html#fig_distributed-consensus_colocated-failure">Figure 23-12</a>, in this failure
          scenario, all of the leaders should fail over to another datacenter, either split evenly
          or en masse into one datacenter. In either case, the link between the other two
          datacenters will suddenly receive a lot more network traffic from this system. This would
          be an inopportune moment to discover that the capacity on that link is insufficient.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          However, this type of deployment could easily be an unintended result of automatic
          processes in the system that have bearing on how leaders are chosen. For instance:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clients will experience better latency for any operations handled via the leader if
          the leader is located closest to them. An algorithm that attempts to site leaders near
          the bulk of clients could take advantage of this insight.
          </li>
          <li>An algorithm might try to locate leaders on machines with the best performance. A
          pitfall of this approach is that if one of the three datacenters houses faster machines,
          then a disproportionate amount of traffic will be sent to that datacenter, resulting in
          extreme traffic changes should that datacenter go offline. To avoid this problem, the
          algorithm must also take into account distribution balance against machine capabilities
          when selecting machines.
          </li>
          <li>A leader election algorithm might favor processes that have been running longer.
          Longer-running processes are quite likely to be correlated with location if software
          releases are performed on a per-datacenter basis.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="subheaders">
          Quorum composition
        </h3>
        <p>
          When determining where to locate replicas in a consensus group, it is important to
          consider the effect of the geographical distribution (or, more precisely, the network
          latencies between replicas) on the performance of the group.
        </p>
        <p>
          One approach is to spread the replicas as evenly as possible, with similar RTTs between
          all replicas. All other factors being equal (such as workload, hardware, and network
          performance), this arrangement should lead to fairly consistent performance across all
          regions, regardless of where the group leader is located (or for each member of the
          consensus group, if a leaderless protocol is in use).
        </p>
        <p>
          Geography can greatly complicate this approach. This is particularly true for
          intra-continental versus transpacific and transatlantic traffic. Consider a system that
          spans North America and Europe: it is impossible to locate replicas equidistant from each
          other because there will always be a longer lag for transatlantic traffic than for
          intracontinental traffic. No matter what, transactions from one region will need to make
          a transatlantic round trip in order to reach consensus.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, as shown in <a href="managing-critical-state.html#fig_distributed-consensus_overlapping-quorums">Figure
          23-13</a>, in order to try to distribute traffic as evenly as possible, systems designers
          might choose to site five replicas, with two replicas roughly centrally in the US, one on
          the east coast, and two in Europe. Such a distribution would mean that in the average
          case, consensus could be achieved in North America without waiting for replies from
          Europe, or that from Europe, consensus can be achieved by exchanging messages only with
          the east coast replica. The east coast replica acts as a linchpin of sorts, where two
          possible quorums overlap.
        </p>

          As shown in <a href="managing-critical-state.html#fig_distributed-consensus_overlapping-quorums-failure">Figure

          drastically: instead of being largely influenced by either central US to east coast RTT
          or EU to east coast RTT, latency will be based on EU to central RTT, which is around 50%
          higher than EU to east coast RTT. The geographic distance and network RTT between the
          nearest possible quorum increases enormously.

          This scenario is a key weakness of the simple majority quorum when applied to groups
          composed of replicas with very different RTTs between members. In such cases, a
          hierarchical quorum approach may be useful. As diagrammed in <a href=

          deployed in three groups of three. A quorum may be formed by a majority of groups, and a
          group may be included in the quorum if a majority of the groupâ€™s members are available.
          This means that a replica may be lost in the central group without incurring a large
          impact on overall system performance because the central group may still vote on
          transactions with two of its three replicas.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is, however, a resource cost associated with running a higher number of replicas.
          In a highly sharded system with a read-heavy workload that is largely fulfillable by
          replicas, we might mitigate this cost by using fewer consensus groups. Such a strategy
          means that the overall number of processes in the system may not change.

          Monitoring Distributed Consensus Systems
        </h1>
        <p>
          As weâ€™ve already seen, distributed consensus algorithms are at the core of many of
          Googleâ€™s critical systems (<a href="bibliography.html#Ana13" target=
          "_blank">[Ana13]</a>, <a href="bibliography.html#Bur06" target=
          "_blank">[Bur06]</a>, <a href="bibliography.html#Cor12" target=
          "_blank">[Cor12]</a>, <a href="bibliography.html#Shu13" target=
          "_blank">[Shu13]</a>). All important production systems need monitoring, in order to
          detect outages or problems and for troubleshooting. Experience has shown us that there
          are certain specific aspects of distributed consensus systems that warrant special
          attention. These are:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            The number of members running in each consensus group, and the status of each process
            (healthy or not healthy)
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              A process may be running but unable to make progress for some (e.g.,
              hardware-related) reason.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Persistently lagging replicas
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Healthy members of a consensus group can still potentially be in multiple different
              states. A group member may be recovering state from peers after startup, or lagging
              behind the quorum in the group, or it may be up-to-date and participating fully, and
              it may be the leader.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Whether or not a leader exists
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              A system based on an algorithm such as Multi-Paxos that uses a leader role must be
              monitored to ensure that a leader exists, because if the system has no leader, it is
              totally unavailable.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Number of leader changes
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Rapid changes of leadership impair performance of consensus systems that use a stable
              leader, so the number of leader changes should be monitored. Consensus algorithms
              usually mark a leadership change with a new term or view number, so this number
              provides a useful metric to monitor. Too rapid of an increase in leader changes
              signals that the leader is flapping, perhaps due to network connectivity issues. A
              decrease in the view number could signal a serious bug.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Consensus transaction number
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Operators need to know whether or not the consensus system is making progress. Most
              consensus algorithms use an increasing consensus transaction number to indicate
              progress. This number should be seen to be increasing over time if a system is
              healthy.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Number of proposals seen; number of proposals agreed upon
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              These numbers indicate whether or not the system is operating correctly.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Throughput and latency
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Although not specific to distributed consensus systems, these characteristics of
              their consensus system should be monitored and understood by administrators.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          In order to understand system performance and to help troubleshoot performance issues,
          you might also monitor the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Latency distributions for proposal acceptance
          </li>
          <li>Distributions of network latencies observed between parts of the system in different
          locations
          </li>
          <li>The amount of time acceptors spend on durable logging
          </li>
          <li>Overall bytes accepted per second in the system
          </li>
        </ul>

          Conclusion
        </h1>
        <p>
          We explored the definition of the distributed consensus problem, and presented some
          system architecture patterns for distributed-consensus based systems, as well as
          examining the performance characteristics and some of the operational concerns around
          distributed consensusâ€“based systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          We deliberately avoided an in-depth discussion about specific algorithms, protocols, or
          implementations in this chapter. Distributed coordination systems and the technologies
          underlying them are evolving quickly, and this information would rapidly become out of
          date, unlike the fundamentals that are discussed here. However, these fundamentals, along
          with the articles referenced throughout this chapter, will enable you to use the
          distributed coordination tools available today, as well as future <span>software</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you remember nothing else from this chapter, keep in mind the sorts of problems that
          distributed consensus can be used to solve, and the types of problems that can arise when
          ad hoc methods such as heartbeats are used instead of distributed consensus. Whenever you
          see leader election, critical shared state, or distributed locking, think about
          distributed consensus: any lesser approach is a ticking bomb waiting to explode in your
          systems.
