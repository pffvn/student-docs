              SRE Engagement: What, How, and Why
            </h1>
            <p>
              <a data-primary="SRE engagement model" data-secondary="importance of" data-type=
              "indexterm" id="id-8nCmSnF7tva"></a><a data-primary="engagements" data-see=
              "SRE engagement model" data-type="indexterm" id="id-mwCPFyFotQb"></a>We've discussed
              in most of the rest of this book what happens when SRE is <em>already</em> in charge
              of a service. Few services begin their lifecycle enjoying SRE support, so there needs
              to be a process for evaluating a service, making sure that it merits SRE support,
              negotiating how to improve any deficits that bar SRE support, and actually
              instituting SRE support. We call this process <em>onboarding</em>. If you are in an
              environment where you are surrounded by a lot of existing services in varying states
              of perfection, your SRE team will probably be running through a prioritized queue of
              onboardings for quite a while until the team has finished taking on the highest-value
              targets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although this is very common, and a completely reasonable way of dealing with a
              <em>fait accompli</em> environment, there are actually at least two better ways of
              bringing the wisdom of production, and SRE support, to services old and new alike.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the first case, just as in software engineering—where the earlier the bug is
              found, the cheaper it is to fix—the earlier an SRE team consultation happens, the
              better the service will be and the quicker it will feel the benefit. When SRE is
              engaged during the earliest stages of <em>design</em>, the time to onboard is lowered
              and the service is more reliable "out of the gate," usually because we don't have to
              spend the time unwinding suboptimal design or implementation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another way, perhaps the best, is to short-circuit the process by which specially
              created systems with lots of individual variations end up "arriving" at SRE's door.
              Provide product development with a <em>platform</em> of SRE-validated infrastructure,
              upon which they can build their systems. This platform will have the double benefit
              of being both reliable and scalable. This avoids certain classes of cognitive load
              problems entirely, and by addressing common infrastructure practices, allows product
              development teams to focus on innovation at the application layer, where it mostly
              belongs.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the following sections, we'll spend some time looking at each of these models in
              turn, beginning with the "classic" one, the PRR-driven model.

              "id-dkCbFyFvhVD"></a>The most typical initial step of SRE engagement is the
              Production Readiness Review (PRR), a process that identifies the reliability needs of
              a service based on its specific details. Through a PRR, SREs seek to apply what
              they've learned and experienced to ensure the reliability of a service operating in
              production. A PRR is considered a prerequisite for an SRE team to accept
              responsibility for managing the production aspects of a service.

              illustrates the lifecycle of a typical service. The Production Readiness Review can
              be started at any point of the service lifecycle, but the stages at which SRE
              engagement is applied have expanded over time. This chapter describes the Simple PRR
              Model, then discusses how its modification into the Extended Engagement Model and the
              Frameworks and SRE Platform structure allowed SRE to scale their engagement process
              and impact.

                Not all Google services receive close SRE engagement. A couple of factors are at
                play here:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Many services don't need high reliability and availability, so support can be
                provided by other means.
                </li>
                <li>By design, the number of development teams that request SRE support exceeds the
                available bandwidth of SRE teams (see <a data-type="xref" href=
                "introduction.html">Introduction</a>).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                When SRE can't provide full-fledged support, it provides other options for making
                improvements to production, such as documentation and consultation.

                  Developers may also seek SRE consulting to discuss specific services or problem
                  areas. The Launch Coordination Engineering (LCE) team (see <a data-type="xref"
                  href="reliable-product-launches.html">Reliable Product
                  Launches at Scale</a>) spends a majority of its time consulting with development
                  teams. SRE teams that aren't specifically dedicated to launch consultations also
                  engage in consultation with development teams.

                  When a new service or a new feature has been implemented, developers usually
                  consult with SRE for advice about preparing for the Launch phase. Launch
                  consultation usually involves one or two SREs spending a few hours studying the
                  design and implementation at a high level. The SRE consultants then meet with the
                  development team to provide advice on risky areas that need attention and to
                  discuss well-known patterns or solutions that can be incorporated to improve the
                  service in production. Some of this advice may come from the Production Guide
                  mentioned earlier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Consultation sessions are necessarily broad in scope because it's not possible to
                  gain a deep understanding of a given system in the limited time available. For
                  some development teams, consultation is not sufficient:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Services that have grown by orders of magnitude since they launched, which
                  now require more time to understand than is feasible through documentation and
                  consultation.
                  </li>
                  <li>Services upon which many other services have subsequently come to rely upon,
                  which now host significantly more traffic from many different clients.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  These types of services may have grown to the point at which they begin to
                  encounter significant difficulties in production while simultaneously becoming
                  important to users. In such cases, long-term SRE engagement becomes necessary to
                  ensure that they are properly maintained in production as they grow.

              Production Readiness Reviews: Simple PRR Model

              "Production Readiness Review" data-type="indexterm" id="SEMprr32"></a>When a
              development team requests that SRE take over production management of a service, SRE
              gauges both the importance of the service and the availability of SRE teams. If the
              service merits SRE support, and the SRE team and development organization agree on
              staffing levels to facilitate this support, SRE initiates a Production Readiness
              Review with the development team.
            </p>
            <p>
              The objectives of the Production Readiness Review are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Verify that a service meets accepted standards of production setup and
              operational readiness, and that service owners are prepared to work with SRE and take
              advantage of SRE expertise.
              </li>
              <li>Improve the reliability of the service in production, and minimize the number and
              severity of incidents that might be expected. A PRR targets all aspects of production
              that SRE cares about.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After sufficient improvements are made and the service is deemed ready for SRE
              support, an SRE team assumes its production responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              This brings us to the Production Readiness Review process itself. There are three
              different but related engagement models (Simple PRR Model, Early Engagement Model,
              and Frameworks and SRE Platform), which will be discussed in turn.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will first describe the Simple PRR Model, which is usually targeted at a service
              that is already launched and will be taken over by an SRE team. A PRR follows several
              phases, much like a development lifecycle, although it may proceed independently in
              parallel with the development lifecycle.

                selected or self-nominated to conduct the PRR process. This small group then
                initiates discussion with the development team. The discussion covers matters such
                as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Establishing an SLO/SLA for the service

                The goal is to arrive at a common agreement about the process, end goals, and
                outcomes that are necessary for the SRE team to engage with the development team
                and their service.

                Analysis
              </h2>
              <p>
                Analysis is the first large segment of work. During this phase, the SRE reviewers
                learn about the service and begin analyzing it for production shortcomings. They
                aim to gauge the maturity of the service along the various axes of concern to SRE.
                They also examine the service's design and implementation to check if it follows
                production best practices. Usually, the SRE team establishes and maintains a PRR
                checklist explicitly for the Analysis phase. The checklist is specific to the
                service and is generally based on domain expertise, experience with related or
                similar systems, and best practices from the Production Guide. The SRE team may
                also consult other teams that have more experience with certain components or
                dependencies of the service.
              </p>
              <p class="pagebreak-before">
                A few examples of checklist items include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Do updates to the service impact an unreasonably large percentage of the system
                at once?
                </li>
                <li>Does the service connect to the appropriate serving instance of its
                dependencies? For example, end-user requests to a service should not depend on a
                system that is designed for a batch-processing use case.
                </li>
                <li>Does the service request a sufficiently high network quality-of-service when
                talking to a critical remote service?
                </li>
                <li>Does the service report errors to central logging systems for analysis? Does it
                report all exceptional conditions that result in degraded responses or failures to
                the end users?
                </li>
                <li>Are all user-visible request failures well instrumented and monitored, with
                suitable alerting configured?
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The checklist may also include operational standards and best practices followed by
                a specific SRE team. For example, a perfectly functional service configuration that
                doesn't follow an SRE team's "gold standard" might be refactored to work better
                with SRE tools for scalably managing configurations. SREs also look at recent
                incidents and postmortems for the service, as well as follow-up tasks for the
                incidents. This evaluation gauges the demands of emergency response for the service
                and the availability of well-established operational controls.

              <p>
                The Analysis phase leads to the identification of recommended improvements for the
                service. This next phase proceeds as follows:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Improvements are prioritized based upon importance for service reliability.
                </li>
                <li>The priorities are discussed and negotiated with the development team, and a
                plan of execution is agreed upon.
                </li>
                <li>Both SRE and product development teams participate and assist each other in
                refactoring parts of the service or implementing additional features.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                This phase typically varies the most in duration and amount of effort. How much
                time and effort this phase will involve depends upon the availability of
                engineering time for refactoring, the maturity and complexity of the service at the
                start of the review, and myriad other factors.

                Responsibility for managing a service in production is generally assumed by an
                entire SRE team. To ensure that the team is prepared, the SRE reviewers who led the
                PRR take ownership of training the team, which includes the documentation necessary
                to support the service. Typically with the help and participation of the
                development team, these engineers organize a series of training sessions and
                exercises. Instruction can include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Design overviews
                </li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                When the training is concluded, the SRE team should be prepared to manage the
                service.

                The Training phase unblocks onboarding of the service by the SRE team. It involves
                a progressive transfer of responsibilities and ownership of various production
                aspects of the service, including parts of operations, the change management
                process, access rights, and so forth. The SRE team continues to focus on the
                various areas of production mentioned earlier. To complete the transition, the
                development team must be available to back up and advise the SRE team for a period
                of time as it settles in managing production for the service. This relationship
                becomes the basis for the ongoing work between the teams.

              <p>
                Active services continuously change in response to new demands and conditions,
                including user requests for new features, evolving system dependencies, and
                technology upgrades, in addition to other factors. The SRE team must maintain
                service reliability standards in the face of these changes by driving continuous
                improvement. The responsible SRE team naturally learns more about the service in
                the course of operating the service, reviewing new changes, responding to
                incidents, and especially when conducting postmortems/root cause analyses. This
                expertise is shared with the development team as suggestions and proposals for
                changes to the service whenever new features, components, and dependencies may be
                added to the service. Lessons from managing the service are also contributed to
                best practices, which are documented in the Production Guide and elsewhere.

                  Engaging with Shakespeare
                </h5>
                <p>
                  Initially, the developers of the Shakespeare service were responsible for the
                  product, including carrying the pager for emergency response. However, with
                  growing use of the service and the growth of the revenue coming from the service,
                  SRE support became desirable. The product has already been launched, so SRE
                  conducted a Production Readiness Review. One of the things they found was that
                  the dashboards were not completely covering some of the metrics defined in the
                  SLO, so that needed to be fixed. After all the issues that had been filed had
                  been fixed, SRE took over the pager for the service, though two developers were
                  in the on-call rotation as well. The developers are participating in the weekly
                  on-call meeting discussing last week's problems and how to handle upcoming
                  large-scale maintenance or cluster turndowns. Also future plans for the service
                  are now discussed with the SREs to make sure that new launches will go flawlessly
                  (though Murphy's law is always looking for opportunities to spoil
                  that).<a data-primary="" data-startref="SEMprr32" data-type="indexterm" id=

              Evolving the Simple PRR Model: Early Engagement

              data-type="indexterm" id="earlyeng32"></a>Thus far, we've discussed the Production
              Readiness Review as it's used in the Simple PRR Model, which is limited to services
              that have already entered the Launch phase. There are several limitations and costs
              associated with this model. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Additional communication between teams can increase some process overhead for the
              development team, and cognitive burden for the SRE reviewers.
              </li>
              <li>The right SRE reviewers must be available, and capable of managing their time and
              priorities with regards to their existing engagements.
              </li>
              <li>Work done by SREs must be highly visible and sufficiently reviewed by the
              development team to ensure effective knowledge sharing. SREs should essentially work
              as a part of the development team, rather than an external unit.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              However, the main limitations of the PRR Model stem from the fact that the service is
              launched and serving at scale, and the SRE engagement starts very late in the
              development lifecycle. If the PRR occurred earlier in the service lifecycle, SRE's
              opportunity to remedy potential issues in the service would be markedly increased. As
              a result, the success of the SRE engagement and the future success of the service
              itself would likely improve. The resulting drawbacks can pose a significant challenge
              to the success of the SRE engagement and the future success of the service itself.

                Candidates for Early Engagement
              </h2>
              <p>
                The Early Engagement Model introduces SRE earlier in the development lifecycle in
                order to achieve significant additional advantages. Applying the Early Engagement
                Model requires identifying the importance and/or business value of a service early
                in the development lifecycle, and determining if the service will have sufficient
                scale or complexity to benefit from SRE expertise. Applicable services often have
                the following characteristics:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The service implements significant new functionality and will be part of an
                existing system already managed by SRE.
                </li>
                <li>The service is a significant rewrite or alternative to an existing system,
                targeting the same use cases.
                </li>
                <li>The development team sought SRE advice or approached SRE for takeover upon
                launch.

                The Early Engagement Model essentially immerses SREs in the development process.
                SRE's focus remains the same, though the means to achieve a better production
                service are different. SRE participates in Design and later phases, eventually
                taking over the service any time during or after the Build phase. This model is
                based on active collaboration between the development and SRE teams.

              <p>
                While the Early Engagement Model does entail certain risks and challenges discussed
                previously, additional SRE expertise and collaboration during the entire lifecycle
                of the product creates significant benefits compared to an engagement initiated
                later in the service lifecycle.

                  SRE collaboration during the Design phase can prevent a variety of problems or
                  incidents from occurring later in production. While design decisions can be
                  reversed or rectified later in the development lifecycle, such changes come at a
                  high cost in terms of effort and complexity. The best production incidents are
                  those that never happen!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Occasionally, difficult trade-offs lead to the selection of a less-than-ideal
                  design. Participation in the Design phase means that SREs are aware up front of
                  the trade-offs and are part of the decision to pick a less-than-ideal option.
                  Early SRE involvement aims to minimize future disputes over design choices once
                  the service is in production.

                  The Build phase addresses production aspects such as instrumentation and metrics,
                  operational and emergency controls, resource usage, and efficiency. During this
                  phase, SRE can influence and improve the implementation by recommending specific
                  existing libraries and components, or helping build certain controls into the
                  system. SRE participation at this stage helps enable ease of operations in the
                  future and allows SRE to gain operational experience in advance of the launch.

                <p>
                  SRE can also help implement widely used launch patterns and controls. For
                  example, SRE might help implement a "dark launch" setup, in which part of the
                  traffic from existing users is sent to the new service in addition to being sent
                  to the live production service. The responses from the new service are "dark"
                  since they are thrown away and not actually shown to users. Practices such as
                  dark launches allow the team to gain operational insight, resolve issues without
                  impacting existing users, and reduce the risk of encountering issues after
                  launch. A smooth launch is immensely helpful in keeping the operational burden
                  low and maintaining the development momentum after the launch. Disruptions around
                  launch can easily result in emergency changes to source code and production, and
                  disrupt the development team's work on future features.

                <p>
                  Having a stable system at launch time generally leads to fewer conflicting
                  priorities for the development team in terms of choosing between improving
                  service reliability versus adding new features. In later phases of the service,
                  the lessons from earlier phases can better inform refactoring or redesign.

                <p>
                  With extended involvement, the SRE team can be ready to take over the new service
                  much sooner than is possible with the Simple PRR Model. The longer and closer
                  engagement between the SRE and development teams also creates a collaborative
                  relationship that can be sustained long term. A positive cross-team relationship
                  fosters a mutual feeling of solidarity, and helps SRE establish ownership of the
                  production responsibility.

                <p>
                  Sometimes a service doesn't warrant full-fledged SRE team management—this
                  determination might be made post-launch, or SRE might engage with a service but
                  never officially take it over. This is a positive outcome, because the service
                  has been engineered to be reliable and low maintenance, and can therefore remain
                  with the development team.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is also possible that SRE engages early with a service that fails to meet the
                  levels of usage projected. In such cases, the SRE effort spent is simply part of
                  the overall business risk that comes with new projects, and a small cost relative
                  to the success of projects that meet expected scale. The SRE team can be
                  reassigned, and lessons learned can be incorporated into the engagement

                Lessons Learned
              </h2>
              <p>
                Over time, the SRE engagement model described thus far produced several distinct
                patterns:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Onboarding each service required two or three SREs and typically lasted two or
                three quarters. The lead times for a PRR were relatively high (quarters away). The
                effort level required was proportional to the number of services under review, and
                was constrained by the insufficient number of SREs available to conduct PRRs. These
                conditions led to serialization of service takeovers and strict service
                prioritization.
                </li>
                <li>Due to differing software practices across services, each production feature
                was implemented differently. To meet PRR-driven standards, features usually had to
                be reimplemented specifically for each service or, at best, once for each small
                subset of services sharing code. These reimplementations were a waste of
                engineering effort. One canonical example is the implementation of functionally
                similar logging frameworks repeatedly in the same language because different
                services didn't implement the same coding structure.
                </li>
                <li>A review of common service issues and outages revealed certain patterns, but
                there was no way to easily replicate fixes and improvements across services.
                Typical examples included service overload situations and data hot-spotting.
                </li>
                <li>SRE software engineering contributions were often local to the service. Thus,
                building generic solutions to be reused was difficult. As a consequence, there was
                no easy way to implement new lessons individual SRE teams learned and best
                practices across services that had already been onboarded.

                External Factors Affecting SRE
              </h2>
              <p>
                External factors have traditionally pressured the SRE organization and its
                resources in several ways.
              </p>
              <p>
                Google is increasingly following the industry trend of moving toward
                microservices.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="evolving-sre-engagement-model.html#id-oAduAS7I8t2uXl" id=
                "id-oAduAS7I8t2uXl-marker">151</a></sup> As a result, both the number of requests
                for SRE support and the cardinality of services to support have increased. Because
                each service has a base fixed operational cost, even simple services demand more
                staffing. Microservices also imply an expectation of lower lead time for
                deployment, which was not possible with the previous PRR model (which had a lead
                time of months).
              </p>
              <p>
                Hiring experienced, qualified SREs is difficult and costly. Despite enormous effort
                from the recruiting organization, there are never enough SREs to support all the
                services that need their expertise. Once SREs are hired, their training is also a
                lengthier process than is typical for development engineers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, the SRE organization is responsible for serving the needs of the large and
                growing number of development teams that do not already enjoy direct SRE support.
                This mandate calls for extending the SRE support model far beyond the original
                concept and engagement model.

                    than hand collecting and analyzing mostly raw data from disparate sources

              </dl>
              <p>
                Based upon these principles, a set of SRE-supported platform and service frameworks
                were created, one for each environment we support(Java, C++, Go). Services built
                using these frameworks share implementations that are designed to work with the
                SRE-supported platform, and are maintained by both SRE and development teams. The
                main shift brought about by frameworks was to enable product development teams to
                design applications using the framework solution that was built and blessed by SRE,
                as opposed to either retrofitting the application to SRE specifications after the
                fact, or retrofitting more SREs to support a service that was markedly different
                than other Google services.
              </p>
              <p>
                An application typically comprises some business logic, which in turn depends on
                various infrastructure components. SRE production concerns are largely focused on
                the infrastructure-related parts of a service. The service frameworks implement
                infrastructure code in a standardized fashion and address various production
                concerns. Each concern is encapsulated in one or more framework modules, each of
                which provides a cohesive solution for a problem domain or infrastructure
                dependency. Framework modules address the various SRE concerns enumerated earlier,
                such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Instrumentation and metrics
                </li>
                <li>Request logging
                </li>
                <li>Control systems involving traffic and load management
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                SRE builds framework modules to implement canonical solutions for the concerned
                production area. As a result, development teams can focus on the business logic,
                because the framework already takes care of correct infrastructure use.
              </p>
              <p>
                A framework essentially is a prescriptive implementation for using a set of
                software components and a canonical way of combining these components. The
                framework can also expose features that control various components in a cohesive
                manner. For example, a framework might provide the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Business logic organized as well-defined semantic components that can be
                referenced using standard terms
                </li>
                <li>Standard dimensions for monitoring instrumentation
                </li>
                <li>A standard format for request debugging logs
                </li>
                <li>A standard configuration format for managing load shedding
                </li>
                <li>Capacity of a single server and determination of "overload" that can both use a
                semantically consistent measure for feedback to various control systems
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Frameworks provide multiple upfront gains in consistency and efficiency. They free
                developers from having to glue together and configure individual components in an
                ad hoc service-specific manner, in ever-so-slightly incompatible ways, that then
                have to be manually reviewed by SREs. They drive a single reusable solution for
                production concerns across services, which means that framework users end up with
                the same common implementation and minimal configuration differences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Google supports several major languages for application development, and frameworks
                are implemented across all of these languages. While different implementations of
                the framework (say in C++ versus Java) can't share code, the goal is to expose the
                same API, behavior, configuration, and controls for identical functionality.
                Therefore, development teams can choose the language platform that fits their needs
                and experience, while SREs can still expect the same familiar behavior in
                production and standard tools to manage the <span class=

                  <li>It enables much faster deployment: an idea can graduate to fully deployed

                  The constant growth in the number of services at Google means that most of these
                  services can neither warrant SRE engagement nor be maintained by SREs.
                  Regardless, services that don't receive full SRE support can be built to use
                  production features that are developed and maintained by SREs. This practice
                  effectively breaks the SRE staffing barrier. Enabling SRE-supported production
                  standards and tools for all teams improves the overall service quality across
                  Google. Furthermore, all services that are implemented with frameworks
                  automatically benefit from improvements made over time to frameworks modules.

                  The frameworks approach results in faster PRR execution because we can rely upon:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Built-in service features as part of the framework implementation
                  </li>
                  <li>Faster service onboarding (usually accomplished by a single SRE during one
                  quarter)
                  </li>
                  <li>Less cognitive burden for the SRE teams managing services built using
                  <span class="keep-together">frameworks</span>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  These properties allow SRE teams to lower the assessment and qualification effort
                  for service onboarding, while maintaining a high bar on service production
                  quality.

                  The original SRE engagement model presented only two options: either full SRE
                  support, or approximately no SRE engagement.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href=

                  A production platform with a common service structure, conventions, and software
                  infrastructure made it possible for an SRE team to provide support for the
                  "platform" infrastructure, while the development teams provide on-call support
                  for functional issues with the service—that is, for bugs in the application code.
                  Under this model, SREs assume responsibility for the development and maintenance
                  of large parts of service software infrastructure, particularly control systems
                  such as load shedding, overload, automation, traffic management, logging, and
                  monitoring.

            Conclusion
          </h1>
          <p>
            Service reliability can be improved through SRE engagement, in a process that includes
            systematic review and improvement of its production aspects. Google SRE’s initial such
            systematic approach, the Simple Production Readiness Review, made strides in
            standardizing the SRE engagement model, but was only applicable to services that had
            already entered the Launch phase.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, SRE extended and improved this model. The Early Engagement Model involved
            SRE earlier in the development lifecycle in order to "design for reliability." As
            demand for SRE expertise continued to grow, the need for a more scalable engagement
            model became increasingly apparent. Frameworks for production services were developed
            to meet this demand: code patterns based on production best practices were standardized
            and encapsulated in frameworks, so that use of frameworks became a recommended,
            consistent, and relatively simple way of building production-ready services.
          </p>
          <p>
            All three of the engagement models described are still practiced within Google.
            However, the adoption of frameworks is becoming a prominent influence on building
            production-ready services at Google as well as profoundly expanding the SRE
            contribution, lowering service management overhead, and improving baseline service
            quality across the organization.

            consulting engagements by SRE teams with some non-onboarded services, but consultations
            were a best-effort approach and limited in number and scope.

            <sup><a href="evolving-sre-engagement-model.html#id-8ZQuEFQt2TVTyu7K-marker">153</a></sup>The new model of service
            management changes the SRE staffing model in two ways: (1) because a lot of service
            technology is common, it reduces the number of required SREs per service; (2) it
            enables the creation of production platforms with separation of concerns between
            production platform support (done by SREs) and service-specific business-logic support,
            which remains with the development team. These platforms teams are staffed based upon
            the need to maintain the platform rather than upon service count, and can be shared
            across products.
