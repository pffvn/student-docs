          In SRE, we want to spend time on long-term engineering project work instead of
          operational work. Because the term <em>operational work</em> may be misinterpreted, we
          use a specific word: <em>toil</em>.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">
          Toil Defined
        </h1>
        <p>
          Toil is not just "work I don’t like to do." It’s also not simply equivalent to
          administrative chores or grungy work. Preferences as to what types of work are satisfying
          and enjoyable vary from person to person, and some people even enjoy manual, repetitive
          work. There are also administrative chores that have to get done, but should not be
          categorized as toil: this is <em>overhead</em>. Overhead is often work not directly tied
          to running a production service, and includes tasks like team meetings, setting and
          grading goals,<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="eliminating-toil.html#id-dA2uXtyF9Tk" id=
          "id-dA2uXtyF9Tk-marker">19</a></sup> snippets,<sup><a data-type="noteref" href=
          "eliminating-toil.html#id-BWDu1hjFGTg" id="id-BWDu1hjFGTg-marker">20</a></sup> and HR paperwork. Grungy work
          can sometimes have long-term value, and in that case, it’s not toil, either. Cleaning up
          the entire alerting configuration for your service and removing clutter may be grungy,
          but it’s not toil.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what <em>is</em> toil? Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service
          that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and
          that scales linearly as a service grows. Not every task deemed toil has all these
          attributes, but the more closely work matches one or more of the following descriptions,
          the more likely it is to be toil:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Manual
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              This includes work such as manually running a script that automates some task.
              Running a script may be quicker than manually executing each step in the script, but
              the <em>hands-on</em> time a human spends running that script (not the elapsed time)
              is still toil time.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Repetitive
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              If you’re performing a task for the first time ever, or even the second time, this
              work is not toil. Toil is work you do over and over. If you’re solving a novel
              problem or inventing a new solution, this work is not toil.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Automatable
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              If a machine could accomplish the task just as well as a human, or the need for the
              task could be designed away, that task is toil. If human judgment is essential for
              the task, there’s a good chance it’s not toil.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href=
              "eliminating-toil.html#id-EYJuMSqSwTgtKTk" id="id-EYJuMSqSwTgtKTk-marker">21</a></sup>

          <dd>
            <p>
              Toil is interrupt-driven and reactive, rather than strategy-driven and proactive.
              Handling pager alerts is toil.We may never be able to eliminate this type of work
              completely, but we have to continually work toward minimizing it.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">

          <dd>
            <p>
              If your service remains in the same state after you have finished a task, the task
              was probably toil. If the task produced a permanent improvement in your service, it
              probably wasn’t toil, even if some amount of grunt work—such as digging into legacy
              code and configurations and straightening them out—was involved.

            O(n) with service growth
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              If the work involved in a task scales up linearly with service size, traffic volume,
              or user count, that task is probably toil. An ideally managed and designed service
              can grow by at least one order of magnitude with zero additional work, other than
              some one-time efforts to add resources.

          Why Less Toil Is Better
        </h1>
        <p>
          Our SRE organization has an advertised goal of keeping operational work (i.e., toil)
          below 50% of each SRE’s time. At least 50% of each SRE’s time should be spent on
          engineering project work that will either reduce future toil or add service features.
          Feature development typically focuses on improving reliability, performance, or
          utilization, which often reduces toil as a second-order effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          We share this 50% goal because toil tends to expand if left unchecked and can quickly
          fill 100% of everyone’s time. The work of reducing toil and scaling up services is the
          "Engineering" in Site Reliability Engineering. Engineering work is what enables the SRE
          organization to scale up sublinearly with service size and to manage services more
          efficiently than either a pure Dev team or a pure Ops team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, when we hire new SREs, we promise them that SRE is not a typical Ops
          organization, quoting the 50% rule just mentioned. We need to keep that promise by not
          allowing the SRE organization or any subteam within it to devolve into an Ops team.
        </p>
        <h5 class="subheaders">
          Calculating Toil
        </h5>
        <p>
          If we seek to cap the time an SRE spends on toil to 50%, how is that time spent?
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s a floor on the amount of toil any SRE has to handle if they are on-call. A
          typical SRE has one week of primary on-call and one week of secondary on-call in each
          cycle (for discussion of primary versus secondary on-call shifts, see <a href=
          "being-on-call.html">Being On-Call</a>). It follows that in a 6-person
          rotation, at least 2 of every 6 weeks are dedicated to on-call shifts and interrupt
          handling, which means the lower bound on potential toil is 2/6 = 33% of an SRE’s time. In
          an 8-person rotation, the lower bound is 2/8 = 25%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consistent with this data, SREs report that their top source of toil is interrupts (that
          is, non-urgent service-related messages and emails). The next leading source is on-call
          (urgent) response, followed by releases and pushes. Even though our release and push
          processes are usually handled with a fair amount of automation, there’s still plenty of
          room for improvement in this area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quarterly surveys of Google’s SREs show that the average time spent toiling is about 33%,
          so we do much better than our overall target of 50%. However, the average doesn’t capture
          outliers: some SREs claim 0% toil (pure development projects with no on-call work) and
          others claim 80% toil. When individual SREs report excessive toil, it often indicates a
          need for managers to spread the toil load more evenly across the team and to encourage
          those SREs to find satisfying engineering projects.
        </p>
        <h1 class="heading">
          What Qualifies as Engineering?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Engineering work is novel and intrinsically requires human judgment. It produces a
          permanent improvement in your service, and is guided by a strategy. It is frequently
          creative and innovative, taking a design-driven approach to solving a problem—the more
          generalized, the better. Engineering work helps your team or the SRE organization handle
          a larger service, or more services, with the same level of staffing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typical SRE activities fall into the following approximate categories:

            Software engineering
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Involves writing or modifying code, in addition to any associated design and
              documentation work. Examples include writing automation scripts, creating tools or
              frameworks, adding service features for scalability and reliability, or modifying
              infrastructure code to make it more robust.

              Involves configuring production systems, modifying configurations, or documenting
              systems in a way that produces lasting improvements from a one-time effort. Examples
              include monitoring setup and updates, load balancing configuration, server
              configuration, tuning of OS parameters, and load balancer setup. Systems engineering
              also includes consulting on architecture, design, and productionization for developer
              teams.

          Every SRE needs to spend at least 50% of their time on engineering work, when averaged
          over a few quarters or a year. Toil tends to be spiky, so a steady 50% of time spent on
          engineering may not be realistic for some SRE teams, and they may dip below that target
          in some quarters. But if the fraction of time spent on projects averages significantly
          below 50% over the long haul, the affected team needs to step back and figure out what’s
          wrong.

          Is Toil Always Bad?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Toil doesn’t make everyone unhappy all the time, especially in small amounts. Predictable
          and repetitive tasks can be quite calming. They produce a sense of accomplishment and
          quick wins. They can be low-risk and low-stress activities. Some people gravitate toward
          tasks involving toil and may even enjoy that type of work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Toil isn’t always and invariably bad, and everyone needs to be absolutely clear that some
          amount of toil is unavoidable in the SRE role, and indeed in almost any engineering role.
          It’s fine in small doses, and if you’re happy with those small doses, toil is not a
          problem. Toil becomes toxic when experienced in large quantities. If you’re burdened with
          too much toil, you should be very concerned and complain loudly. Among the many reasons
          why too much toil is bad, consider the following:

            Career stagnation
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Your career progress will slow down or grind to a halt if you spend too little time
              on projects. Google rewards grungy work when it’s inevitable and has a big positive
              impact, but you can’t make a career out of grunge.

          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Low morale
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              People have different limits for how much toil they can tolerate, but everyone has a
              limit. Too much toil leads to burnout, boredom, and discontent.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          Additionally, spending too much time on toil at the expense of time spent engineering
          hurts an SRE organization in the following ways:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Creates confusion
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              We work hard to ensure that everyone who works in or with the SRE organization
              understands that we are an engineering organization. Individuals or teams within SRE
              that engage in too much toil undermine the clarity of that communication and confuse
              people about our role.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Slows progress
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Excessive toil makes a team less productive. A product’s feature velocity will slow
              if the SRE team is too busy with manual work and firefighting to roll out new
              features promptly.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Sets precedent
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              If you’re too willing to take on toil, your Dev counterparts will have incentives to
              load you down with even more toil, sometimes shifting operational tasks that should
              rightfully be performed by Devs to SRE. Other teams may also start expecting SREs to
              take on such work, which is bad for obvious reasons.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Promotes attrition
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Even if you’re not personally unhappy with toil, your current or future teammates
              might like it much less. If you build too much toil into your team’s procedures, you
              motivate the team’s best engineers to start looking elsewhere for a more rewarding
              job.
            </p>

          <dt class="dt-heading">
            Causes breach of faith
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              New hires or transfers who joined SRE with the promise of project work will feel
              cheated, which is bad for morale.

          Conclusion
        </h1>
        <p>
          If we all commit to eliminate a bit of toil each week with some good engineering, we’ll
          steadily clean up our services, and we can shift our collective efforts to engineering
          for scale, architecting the next generation of services, and building cross-SRE
          toolchains. Let’s invent more, and toil less.

            <sup><a href="eliminating-toil.html#id-EYJuMSqSwTgtKTk-marker">21</a></sup>We have to be careful about
            saying a task is "not toil because it needs human judgment." We need to think carefully
            about whether the nature of the task intrinsically requires human judgment and cannot
            be addressed by better design. For example, one could build (and some have built) a
            service that alerts its SREs several times a day, where each alert requires a complex
            response involving plenty of human judgment. Such a service is poorly designed, with
            unnecessary complexity. The system needs to be simplified and rebuilt to either
            eliminate the underlying failure conditions or deal with these conditions
            automatically. Until the redesign and reimplementation are finished, and the improved
            service is rolled out, the work of applying human judgment to respond to each alert is
            definitely toil.
